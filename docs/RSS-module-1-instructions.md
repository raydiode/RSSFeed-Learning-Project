##### Module 1: Environment Setup

**Overview**
This module focuses on verifying and configuring your development environment. We'll take a systematic approach to check existing installations before making any changes. The goal is to ensure WSL and Docker Desktop are properly configured for our FreshRSS project.

**Learning Objectives**
- Understanding WSL and Docker Desktop integration
- Verifying system requirements
- Learning basic system verification commands
- Understanding when and why to use containers

**Prerequisites**
- Windows 10/11
- Administrator access
- GitHub repository from Module 0

**System Verification Steps**

1. **Check WSL Status**
```bash
# Check WSL version and status
wsl --version
wsl --status

# Verify current distribution
wsl --list --verbose
```
_Expected Outcome: WSL 2 running with Ubuntu distribution_

2. **Verify Docker Desktop Installation**
```bash
# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Verify Docker system info
docker info

# Test Docker functionality
docker run hello-world
```
_Expected Outcome: Docker running with WSL 2 backend_

**Installation Steps (Only if Needed)**

1. **WSL Installation**
- Only needed if WSL checks fail
- Instructions will be provided based on verification results

2. **Docker Desktop Installation**
- Only needed if Docker checks fail
- Download from official Docker website
- Enable WSL 2 backend during installation

**Success Criteria**
- WSL 2 running with Ubuntu distribution
- Docker Desktop installed and running with WSL 2 backend
- Successful hello-world container test
- Understanding of verification commands

**Common Issues and Solutions**
1. WSL related:
   - Not installed
   - Wrong version
   - No default distribution

2. Docker related:
   - Not running
   - WSL 2 backend not enabled
   - Permission issues

**Verification Process**
After each installation or configuration change:
1. Verify status
2. Check for errors
3. Document any issues
4. Test functionality

**Next Steps**
After completing verification:
1. Document working configuration
2. Understand basic Docker commands
3. Prepare for FreshRSS container setup

**Additional Resources**
- Docker Desktop documentation
- WSL installation guide
- Troubleshooting guides

**Notes**
- Container-based development reduces system dependencies
- Document any configuration changes
- Keep error logs for troubleshooting
