Meta recently began adding AI chatbots into specific groups, and has also created different character AIs.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfMivC0pfuVBAFe3fTIyK_CNzsskEbk8UpUSXtRmvumnal9f2KruQYwHjEEn9O8LIz2WpXUy0X14nM6MZOJR4yyhKAOfo571eKKdxaIFLx_QG74oYZOdBCEuaGJ9_igdFkkKCUf4g?key=iPgLEkaDcrcgjf2zheN33Oq8" class="kg-image" alt="AI Chatbot Added to Mushroom Foraging Facebook Group Immediately Gives Tips for Cooking Dangerous Mushroom" loading="lazy" width="624" height="591"></figure><p>Rick Claypool, research director for consumer safety group Public Citizen&#x2019;s president&#x2019;s office, told 404 Media about FungiFriend. Claypool has done important work about corporate capture of local and state governments, but is also an avid mushroom forager and has been documenting the risks of AI tools in mushroom foraging over the last few months. Over the summer, he wrote a <a href="https://fungimag.com/v17i2/v17n2-Claypool.pdf?fbclid=IwY2xjawGgXf9leHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHWyP2kCSwObFoWZZOwpQR-5JvpTRyH3kKLxy2gW9xZWcBFZXw_ba8nVtmw_aem_IsVbBP1kde1Olbx46fa_kQ&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>lengthy article in Fungi Magazine</u></a> that noted &#x201C;emerging AI technologies are being deployed to help beginner foragers identify edible wild mushrooms. Distinguishing edible mushrooms from toxic mushrooms in the wild is a high-risk activity that requires real-world skills that current AI systems cannot reliably emulate.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>One member of the Facebook group said that they asked the AI bot &#x201C;how do you cook Sarcosphaera coronaria,&#x201D; a type of mushroom that was once thought edible but is now known to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720330412?ref=404media.co"><u>hyperaccumulate arsenic</u></a> and has caused a documented death. FungiFriend told the member that it is &#x201C;edible but rare,&#x201D; and said &#x201C;cooking methods mentioned by some enthusiasts include saut&#xE9;ing in butter, adding to soups or stews, and pickling.&#x201D; The situation is reminiscent of <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-is-paying-reddit-60-million-for-fucksmith-to-tell-its-users-to-eat-glue/" rel="noreferrer">Google&apos;s AI telling people to add glue to pizza</a> or eat rocks on the advice of a Redditor named Fucksmith.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfH1kiLA4qG45e6VKb9TBrzp0PV8CDOeIAJpeoD9ne9dU1XLo5fzUw-NSBTLwdHDISWUIbV364CmUVGQn317if0fWcVjVQZ5XNZJe3fgFhgTHz7ErLn3j4U8ea-Q_yQKkaxgrDX1g?key=iPgLEkaDcrcgjf2zheN33Oq8" class="kg-image" alt="AI Chatbot Added to Mushroom Foraging Facebook Group Immediately Gives Tips for Cooking Dangerous Mushroom" loading="lazy" width="624" height="1191"></figure><p>Claypool told 404 Media in a phone call that it is &#x201C;really risky and reckless&#x201D; for Meta to add AI chatbots to groups like this. He said he has tested various AI tools to identify mushrooms and found &#x201C;there is just no way these things have reached a point of being good enough at providing true and factual and verifiable information, especially if we&#x2019;re talking about distinguishing between toxic and edible varieties.&#x201D;</p><p>Having a bot like this automatically added to a Facebook group full of humans who are dedicated in part to helping new foragers avoid accidentally poisoning themselves is particularly insidious. It also highlights the fact that Meta has very few guardrails on how it is injecting AI into its platforms.&#xA0;</p><p>Claypool said people use the group to post photos of mushrooms from their phones while they&#x2019;re in the field. Facebook added the &#x201C;FungiFriend&#x201D; chat as the first option in the group from mobile, meaning Facebook is pushing people to interact with AI, not other humans, on its supposed &#x201C;social network.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;These groups like this are wonderful for connecting people who are going out there in the field or have an emerging interest with connecting people who have a lot of experience who can help guide people away from dangerous stuff. If you are super new to this, there&#x2019;s a good chance you are asking questions about edibility, which is not where you should start,&#x201D; Claypool said. &#x201C;But if you&#x2019;re interacting with people in a group in public and someone gives not so great info, there&#x2019;s a chance there&#x2019;s multiple voices there [correcting it].&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>Conversations with an AI bot, meanwhile, take place in private and may be the first place that new foragers turn if they want to avoid asking what could be seen as a newbie or embarrassing question.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;Somebody who has any amount of knowledge is not going to be relying on the AI. It&#x2019;s going to be someone who feels nervous about putting themselves out there,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Maybe they&#x2019;re worried to seem like they don&#x2019;t know very much or they&#x2019;re afraid of asking a stupid question. So you ask the AI so it won&#x2019;t judge you like a normal person might. You might then not feel like it judges you, but it might kill you.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>

And then I knew like, &#x2018;Oh, that&#x2019;s a license plate reader.&#x2019; I started seeing them all over the place and realized that they were for the police. And I didn&#x2019;t like that.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>Flock is one of the largest vendors of automated license plate readers (ALPRs) in the country. The company markets itself as having the goal to <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/flock-ceo-eliminate-crime?ref=404media.co"><u>fully &#x201C;eliminate crime</u></a>&#x201D; with the use of ALPRs and other connected surveillance cameras, <a href="https://www.404media.co/researcher-who-oversaw-flock-surveillance-study-now-has-concerns-about-it/"><u>a target experts say is impossible</u></a>.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>In Huntsville, Freeman noticed that license plate reader cameras were positioned in a circle at major intersections, forming a perimeter that could track any car going into or out of the city&#x2019;s downtown. He started to look for cameras all over Huntsville and the surrounding areas, and soon found that Flock was not the only game in town. He found cameras owned by Motorola, and a third, owned by a company called Avigilon (a subsidiary of Motorola). Flock and automated license plate reader cameras owned by other companies are now in thousands of neighborhoods around the country. Many of these systems talk to each other and plug into other surveillance systems, making it possible to track people all over the country.&#xA0;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://deflock.me/?ref=404media.co"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">DeFlock</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Your car is being tracked.

I thought, &#x2018;Can I make a database of these license plate readers?&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p>And so <a href="https://deflock.me/?ref=404media.co#map=12/37.875190/-122.279819"><u>he made a map, and called it DeFlock</u></a>. DeFlock runs on Open Street Map, an open source, editable mapping software.

A week later, as I write this, DeFlock has crowdsourced the locations of thousands of cameras in dozens of cities across the United States and the world.</p><p>&#x201C;It still just scratches the surface,&#x201D; Freeman said. &#x201C;I added another page to the site that tracks cities and counties who have transparency reports on Flock&#x2019;s site, and many of those don&#x2019;t have any reported ALPRs though, so it&#x2019;ll help people focus on where to look for them.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-grey"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">&#x1F4A1;</div><div class="kg-callout-text"><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Do you know anything else about ALPRs or Flock?

For example, all of the cameras in downtown Huntsville are pointing away from the downtown core, meaning they are primarily focused on detecting cars that are entering downtown Huntsville from other areas.&#xA0;</p><p>Freeman also said he eventually wants to find a way to offer navigation directions that will allow people to avoid known ALPR cameras. The fact that it is <a href="https://www.404media.co/lawsuit-argues-warrantless-use-of-flock-surveillance-cameras-is-unconstitutional/"><u>impossible to drive in some cities without being passing ALPR cameras</u></a> that track and catalog your car&#x2019;s movements is one of the core arguments in a Fourth Amendment challenge to Flock&#x2019;s existence in Norfolk, Virginia; this project will likely show how infeasible traveling without being tracked actually is in America. Knowing where they are is the first step toward resisting them.&#xA0;</p>

How did these objects grow so big so fast, becoming monsters just a billion years after the Big Bang? It&#x2019;s not an easy question to answer based on existing cosmological models.&#xA0;</p><p>For example, black holes theoretically shouldn&#x2019;t be able to consume matter at a higher rate than what&#x2019;s known as an Eddington limit, which is a measure of the maximum luminosity of an object. But the universe has a way of dispensing with &#x201C;shouldn&#x2019;t.&#x201D; Case in point: Scientists have now observed an ancient black hole named LID-568 that is devouring matter at 40 times its Eddington limit.&#xA0;</p><p>The discovery was made using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which observed LID-568 at 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang. Black holes are often invisible to telescopes, but LID-568 can be seen in X-ray light because it is an active galactic nucleus (AGN), a type of extremely luminous object powered by interactions between a black hole and the matter it consumes.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;This object is similar to other JWST-discovered faint active galactic nuclei populations, but is bright in X-ray emission and accreting at more than 4,000% of the limit at which radiation pressure exceeds the force of gravitational attraction of the black hole (that is, super-Eddington accretion),&#x201D; said researchers led by Hyewon Suh, International Gemini Observatory/NSF NOIRLab.</p><p>The team isn&#x2019;t sure how LID-568 is defying the rules out there, but it&#x2019;s possible that the gas outflows produced by this AGN are removing pressure from the system, allowing it to engorge itself on matter at a previously inconceivable rate. Or, perhaps, some other mechanism is responsible for this phenomenon. We just need to look at more of these early cosmic behemoths to figure out what&#x2019;s driving these sudden growth spurts.&#xA0;</p><p>In the meantime, LID-568&#x2019;s ravenous appetite suggests that black holes in the early universe can swiftly bulk up over a period of millions of years, producing gassy outflows that temporarily extinguish star formation in their host galaxies like candles on a birthday cake. The study calls this the &#x201C;blowout dusty red quasar phase&#x201D; which conveniently doubles as a description of the new political climate.</p><p>LID-568 is about 7 million times as massive as the Sun, which is still relatively small for an active galactic nucleus, but Suh and her team suggest that most of its mass was acquired during this &#x201C;single, super-Eddington accretion episode.&#x201D; That is a major piece of the puzzle for understanding why colossal black holes show up so early in the universe, and how their sudden growth sprouts affect star formation (among other processes) in their host galaxies.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;LID-568 could potentially represent the long-sought-after low-mass black hole undergoing rapid growth through super-Eddington accretion,&#x201D; the team said. &#x201C;This discovery showcases a previously undiscovered key parameter space and offers crucial insights into rapid black hole growth mechanisms in the early universe.&#x201D;</p><h2 id="this-is-your-brain-on-star-wars"><strong>This Is Your Brain on Star Wars</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(24)00726-8?ref=404media.co"><em><u>Rajimehr, Reza et al. &#x201C;Functional architecture of cerebral cortex during naturalistic movie watching,&#x201D; Neuron</u></em></a></p><p>Nothing is more relaxing than kicking back to watch a movie.

These casts preserve victims killed in a pyroclastic flow of superheated ejecta that struck the town, leaving behind bodies that are eerily frozen in their dying forms.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>Scientists have now extracted DNA from these casts for the first time, and the results are full of surprises. Two adults locked in an embrace, often interpreted as sisters, turned out not to be, as at least one of them is male. An adult sitting with a child has been viewed as their mother due to a golden bracelet on their arm, but this person was also revealed to be a man who was unrelated to the child, hinting that modern biases were imposed on the bodies.</p><p>&#x201C;This study illustrates how unreliable narratives based on limited evidence can be, often reflecting the worldview of the researchers at the time,&#x201D; said researchers led by Elena Pilli of the University of Florence, adding that the &#x201C;discoveries challenge longstanding interpretations, such as associating jewelry with femininity or interpreting physical closeness as an indicator of biological relationships.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>Indeed, one takeaway I had from the study is that men wore cool jewelry in Pompeii, as another male victim was found with &#x201C;an iron ring with an engraved carnelian of a female figurine on the little finger of the left hand.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><h2 id="the-case-of-the-kinky-hose"><strong>The Case of the Kinky Hose&#xA0;</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)01371-X?ref=404media.co"><em><u>Urban, Lea et al. &#x201C;Water-hose tool use and showering behavior by Asian elephants,&#x201D; Current Biology</u></em></a></p><p>Finally, let&#x2019;s end this week with a cleansing shower. An elephant shower, that is! In what may be the most delightful study of the week, scientists observed Asian elephants at the Berlin Zoo using water hoses to rinse themselves in &#x201C;elegant and elaborate&#x201D; ways. They also witnessed a possible case of hose tampering as one elephant, Anchali, disrupting water flow while another elephant, Mary, was showering, by clamping and kinking the hose.</p><p>&#x201C;We were wondering whether Anchali purposefully interrupted the water flow going to the showering Mary or whether it was a side-effect of her playing and interacting with the water hose,&#x201D; said researchers led by Lea Urban of the Humboldt University of Berlin.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;Several strands of evidence suggest that Anchali was intentionally aiming to disrupt Mary&#x2019;s shower. (1) Anchali repeatedly showed this complex sequence of trunk maneuvers. (2) Disruptions of the water flow became more effective over time. (3) The hose had to be kinked and squeezed powerfully for disruptions to occur. (4) This occurred in close association with on-hose trunk stands. (5) There would have been a motive for Anchali to interfere with Mary&#x2019;s showering, as there were numerous aggressive acts by Mary toward Anchali. Taken together, these observations led us to suspect that Anchali&#x2019;s kink-and-clamp behavior could reflect a purposeful water-flow-abortion strategy and that the goal could be to sabotage Mary&#x2019;s showering.&#x201D;</p><p>Wow, Anchali, they&#x2019;ve got you dead-to-rights on five counts of shower sabotage. Will Mary seek revenge? Is there risk of escalation? I&#x2019;ll keep you all posted on any follow-up studies about this unfolding elephantine drama.</p><p>Until then, thanks for reading!

<img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2024/11/onur-binay-OKjJZNTl004-unsplash.jpg" alt="Apple Quietly Introduced iPhone Reboot Code Which is Locking Out Cops"><p>Apple quietly introduced code into iOS 18.1 which reboots the device if it has not been unlocked for a period of time, reverting it to a state which improves the security of iPhones overall and is making it harder for police to break into the devices, according to multiple iPhone security experts. </p><p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.404media.co/police-freak-out-at-iphones-mysteriously-rebooting-themselves-locking-cops-out/"><u>404 Media reported</u></a> that law enforcement officials were freaking out that iPhones which had been stored for examination were mysteriously rebooting themselves. At the time the cause was unclear, with the officials only able to speculate why they were being locked out of the devices. Now a day later, the potential reason why is coming into view.</p><p>&#x201C;Apple indeed added a feature called &#x2018;inactivity reboot&#x2019; in iOS 18.1.,&#x201D; Dr.-Ing.

But it appears that in this case the defendant, Jesse Keighin, who usually goes by EveryGameGuru online, got under Nintendo&#x2019;s skin because he didn&#x2019;t stop streaming the emulated games in response to the company&#x2019;s usual tactics.</p><p>Instead, whenever one of his channels was shut down he opened new channels on other platforms, directed his seemingly small audience to pirate Nintendo games, and at times contacted Nintendo to tease the company directly. The lawsuit shows that Nintendo followed Keighin&#x2019;s online activity closely, tracking him across Discord, YouTube, Twitch, Kick, and a number of lesser known streaming platforms.</p><p>&#x201C;On October 24, 2024, after certain platforms had taken down his unlawful streams as a result of Nintendo&#x2019;s enforcement actions, he sent Nintendo a letter boasting that he has &#x2018;a thousand burner channels&#x2019; to stream from and [he] &#x2018;can do this all day,&#x2019;&#x201D; Nintendo says in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25282180-govuscourtscod23864710?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">its lawsuit</a>. According to Nintendo, after his monetized YouTube channel was taken down, Keighin started adding a CashApp handle to his streams seeking donations from the audience.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcj_SBxAjepYjubd1vmotUgBxVeUAlhmvAlkxPRAeXsk7s5EaQU_YRTReis7moaVR3YvLo5c5USTWXAU-5eIvjY4fIYGxdVf2cj8QHGZOTUexjLDRJGBd6ClnyP0DZ2ahroGafq?key=ochq1zpnVL_AfA6NEmMwRZjY" class="kg-image" alt="Nintendo Sues Streamer of Emulated, Pre-Released Games" loading="lazy" width="624" height="147"></figure><p>According to Nintendo, on October 17, 2024, Keighin also told the company that he &#x201C;will actively help people find newer and updated copies of Ryujinx and Yuzu,&#x201D; two Nintendo Switch emulators the company that were taken down from GitHub this year after their creators were <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/switch-emulator-ryujinx-goes-offline-after-creator-gets-an-offer-from-nintendo-they-cant-refuse/?ref=404media.co"><u>contacted</u></a> by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/nintendo-is-suing-the-makers-of-the-switch-emulator-yuzu-claims-there-is-no-lawful-way-to-use-yuzu/?ref=404media.co"><u>Nintendo</u></a>. Keighin also said that he was helping people play Nintendo Switch games &#x201C;on their PC with no need to buy [Nintendo&#x2019;s] hardware,&#x201D; according to the lawsuit.</p><p>&#x201C;LOVE YA&#x2019;LL! CAPITALISM IS CANCER! MY CHANNEL IS BEING DELETED FOR SHARING GAMEPLAY VIDEOS! THIS IS YOUR REWARD!,&#x201D; Keighin said in one of the public posts sharing links to those emulators.&#xA0;</p><p>Of particular concern to Nintendo, it seems, is that Keighin wasn&#x2019;t just streaming emulated, pirated games, but that he was streaming Nintendo games before they were released.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;On at least fifty occasions in the last two years, Defendant has streamed gameplay footage of pirated copies of at least ten different Nintendo games without authorization&#x2014;all before those titles were released to the public,&#x201D; Nintendo said in the lawsuit. &#x201C;All of these streams were unauthorized and all compromise Nintendo&#x2019;s legitimate prerelease marketing. They also promote and encourage downloading of pirated copies of unpublished games. Defendant&#x2019;s streams often consist merely of him playing Nintendo&#x2019;s leaked games without commentary for extended periods of time.&#x201D;</p><p>As an example, Nintendo points to Keighin&#x2019;s streaming of <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> on YouTube and other platforms on October 22. <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership </em>is one of Nintendo&#x2019;s biggest games of the year, and it was officially released this Thursday, November 7.&#xA0;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2024/11/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Nintendo Sues Streamer of Emulated, Pre-Released Games" loading="lazy" width="1267" height="728" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/image.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2024/11/image.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2024/11/image.png 1267w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I could only find one active EveryGameGuru account at the time of writing. It included archives of previous streams, but not a stream of <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>, which appears to have been removed. That channel has only 43 followers. A screenshot in the lawsuit of one of Keighin&#x2019;s YouTube channels shows it had around 1,730 subscribers. Another screenshot in the lawsuit showing Keighin&#x2019;s Kick channel shows it only had one viewer at one point in time.&#xA0;</p><p>According to the lawsuit, Nintendo is seeking $150,000 per infringement of its copyright. Conservatively, going by Nintendo&#x2019;s claim that Keighin streamed pirated gameplay footage &#x201C;on at least fifty occasions in the last two years,&#x201D; he&#x2019;s looking at $7.5 million.</p>

<img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2024/11/404trump--1-.png" alt="Why the Work Still Matters"><p>In the days following Donald Trump&#x2019;s presidential victory, we have seen a larger-than-normal number of people canceling their subscriptions to 404 Media. Alongside these cancellations, many people have explained that they are canceling not because they do not like our articles but because they feel a general sense of depression, that nothing matters, or that they can no longer bear reading the news.&#xA0;</p><p>There were many media outlets who wrote notes to their readers in the immediate aftermath of Trump&#x2019;s shocking victory in 2016. Some of these notes said that their publications would position themselves as a resistance force against Trump, or made grand, sweeping pronouncements about what their work would be able to do. We cannot and will not make false promises to you about the power of journalism&#x2014;especially at a small publication&#x2014;to stop the country&#x2019;s knowing march into authoritarianism. But we can explain our approach to the work and we can demonstrate to you why it matters.&#xA0;</p><p>In 2016, the four of us were at Motherboard, doing work that is very similar to the work that we&#x2019;re still doing today. We have covered technology through one Trump term and intend to continue covering technology through the second Trump term. What we found to be true during Trump&#x2019;s first term, remained true during Joe Biden&#x2019;s presidency, and will remain true as long as we do this: we cannot set the bar for our success at the systemic saving of democracy. Instead, we have found that our work can and does make incremental positive change at the local, state, and federal level, and that, over time, these small improvements become increasingly important.&#xA0;</p><p>The way that we have always done this and the way we will continue to do this is by fearlessly reporting on the ways technology and the powerful people and companies who own these technologies wield it against normal people, but especially against society&#x2019;s most vulnerable people. Over the years, we have been called anti-technology or too cynical. But we are not anti-technology. We want technology that benefits people, and in order to do that we also have to expose how it can invade people&#x2019;s privacy, surveil them, steal their work, steal their bodily autonomy and harass them, destroy any sense of a shared reality, value robotic plagiarism over human creativity, and undermine workers. We will hold companies, people, and politicians who accelerate towards this future to account. But there is another side to this coin. We have, and will continue to champion and amplify people, groups, movements, and ideas that use technology to make our lives better, are fighting back against anti-human uses of technology, and serve to challenge, decentralize, or redistribute power from concentrated big tech companies to the masses.</p>

<p>We&#x2019;ve called this perspective, which we hope shines through in most of our work, two things over the years: &#x201C;Tech populism,&#x201D; and &#x201C;local reporting from the internet.&#x201D; These are very similar but slightly different things. It is not&#x2014;or should not be&#x2014;a radical idea to report stories with the core assumption that technology should make life better for the people who use it and for society as a whole. And it should not be radical to believe that the immense amount of wealth and so-called progress being created from technological progress should be spread evenly and thoughtfully among its users, not tech CEOs and an oligarch class. That &#x201C;progress&#x201D; so far has instead brought us more intensive surveillance capitalism, the widespread theft of artists&#x2019; and writers&#x2019; work, the ransacking of natural resources, and the subjugation of workers in the United States and around the world. Our work is populist in that we recognize that many of the problems plaguing the United States today and which are factors that have laid the groundwork for Trump&#x2019;s return&#x2014;income inequality, a lack of affordable housing, unstable work, the widespread inability to tell what is real and what is fake&#x2014;are being at least partially driven by technology and/or the immense wealth of the people who own tech companies.</p><p>&#x201C;Local reporting from the internet,&#x201D; meanwhile, means telling stories from the perspective of users and often lower-level tech employees, not by begging company communications professionals for access to executives or exclusive new features. Most of our articles tell the stories of hyperspecific communities of people who are using technology or are impacted by it in some way. By focusing on how technology impacts people, we have found that we can impact technology and make the world slightly better, regardless of who the president is.</p><p>This reporting strategy worked in Trump&#x2019;s first term and it will be even more salient in a second term in which he has sought and created an even closer relationship with big tech CEOs. Trump has formed an alliance with Elon Musk and many of Silicon Valley&#x2019;s worst people, the richest and most powerful of whom actively helped him get elected or immediately kissed the ring after he won the election&#x2013;including Jeff Bezos, who <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-billionaire-is-the-threat-not-the-solution/"><u>demanded the newspaper he owns</u></a> kill its planned endorsement of Kamala Harris and then immediately <a href="https://archive.is/jzDMr?ref=404media.co"><u>congratulated Trump</u></a> on his &#x201C;extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory.&#x201D; Trump and especially, Musk, have campaigned on the false idea that mass deregulation and corporatism will somehow help normal people rather than further immiserate them.&#xA0;</p><p>All of this may sound vague or like empty platitudes. So, let&#x2019;s make this concrete.&#xA0;</p><p>In Trump&#x2019;s first term we saw the widespread purging of government science and climate data. We also saw nonprofits, decentralized communities, and random people on the internet form collaborative efforts to successfully <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/scientists-new-role-in-trumps-america-the-resistance-5886b76166d724459909824f/?ref=404media.co"><u>archive and share this data</u></a>. We saw government workers risk their jobs and their freedom to leak critical information about purges happening within their agencies, and expect to see the same in Trump&#x2019;s second term. We filed hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests with federal agencies&#x2014;which may be hamstrung in Trump&#x2019;s second term&#x2014;but we also filed hundreds of public records requests with state and local agencies that uncovered the creation and spread of surveillance systems, revealed that Apple was ordering recyclers to shred <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/apple-recycling-iphones-macbooks/?ref=404media.co"><u>perfectly good iPhones MacBooks into zillions of pieces</u></a> and showed Utah was contracting with a company <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/banjo-ai-company-utah-surveillance-panopticon/?ref=404media.co"><u>turning the state into a surveillance panopticon</u></a> (the CEO of that company was later fired, lost contracts, and had to rebrand). Under Trump, we <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/i-gave-a-bounty-hunter-300-dollars-located-phone-microbilt-zumigo-tmobile/?ref=404media.co"><u>reported on the widespread sale of cell phone location data</u></a> to data brokers and bounty hunters, which led companies to stop the practice and ultimately led <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/fcc-propose-fines-verizon-att-sprint-tmobile-selling-location-data/?ref=404media.co"><u>to multi-hundred million dollar fines from the FCC</u></a>. Under Trump, we saw tech companies monopolize repair but the beginnings of the right to repair movement, the end of &#x201C;<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/warranty-void-if-removed-stickers-illegal-ftc/?ref=404media.co"><u>Warranty Void if Removed</u></a>&#x201D; stickers, and the first pieces of legislation that would ultimately become fair repair laws passed over the last few years. Under Trump, we saw the end of net neutrality but our reporting helped kill big telecom lobbying campaigns and accelerate the rise of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/local-activism-is-the-best-way-to-preserve-the-open-internet/?ref=404media.co"><u>independent locally owned government ISPs</u></a> that are faster, more reliable, and cheaper than the likes of Comcast and Cox. Under Trump, we reported on the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/government-flying-predator-drones-american-cities/?ref=404media.co"><u>use of Predator drones to surveil Black Lives Matter protesters</u></a> and, because of our reporting, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/lawmakers-demand-fbi-dea-cbp-national-guard-stop-spying-george-floyd-protests/?ref=404media.co"><u>we saw Senators fight back</u></a> against this practice. Under Trump, we saw and reported on the rise of the first workers unions in the tech industry, broad protest against the gig economy and algorithmic bosses, and worker rebellions at Amazon, Google, Amazon, Facebook, video game companies, and other major tech companies.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>

<p>In the early days of Trump&#x2019;s first term, we reported on the ways the average person (and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/hacker-turkey-hacks-defaces-donald-trump-website/?ref=404media.co"><u>even hackers</u></a>) <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/second-life-users-are-protesting-with-their-avatars/?ref=404media.co"><u>found their own ways to protest</u></a>, how <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/scientist-hijacks-trump-supporters-hashtag-to-give-us-reigntheswamp/?ref=404media.co"><u>scientists reacted</u></a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/314-action-drafting-scientists-to-run-for-office-to-oppose-trump/?ref=404media.co"><u>fought back</u></a> against the threat of a science-denier administration, and how Trump&#x2019;s team <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-trump-administrations-public-outreach-is-a-mess/?ref=404media.co"><u>approached transparency online</u></a>&#x2013;including the efforts of archivists <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/researchers-are-preparing-for-trump-to-delete-government-science-from-the-web/?ref=404media.co"><u>to preserve digital history</u></a>.&#xA0;</p><p>We started reporting on the impending fallout of FOSTA/SESTA long before Trump signed it into law in 2018: Sex workers told us that instead of saving any sex trafficking victims as part of its stated purpose, it would put more people at risk of exploitation. We listened, we reported on those worries and fears, and when <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/fosta-sesta-sex-work-and-trafficking/?ref=404media.co"><u>they came true</u></a>, we kept reporting on it. When platforms and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/craigslist-personal-ads-sesta-fosta/?ref=404media.co"><u>site sections</u></a> shuttered out of fear of legal retaliation from the Trump administration&#x2019;s war on porn, we talked to everyone from site operators, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/sex-trafficking-bill-sesta-fosta-vote/?ref=404media.co"><u>users, sex workers</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/cloudflare-switter-down-fosta-sesta/?ref=404media.co"><u>hosting providers</u></a> to try to understand how they were affected. Through the years we have covered the ways <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/what-are-incels-redistributing-sex-new-york-times-ross-douthat/?ref=404media.co"><u>bodily autonomy</u></a>, <a href="https://www.404media.co/police-bodycam-shows-sheriff-kootenai-idaho-hunting-for-obscene-books-at-library/"><u>educational institutions</u></a>, and marginalized people are threatened by leaders that align with and promote extremist ideology. We have covered the ways that the data broker industry specifically allows for the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/location-data-abortion-clinics-safegraph-planned-parenthood/?ref=404media.co"><u>targeting</u></a> of women <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-u-s-government-bought-tool-that-can-track-phones-at-abortion-clinics/"><u>seeking abortions</u></a> and sells data to the military about <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/muslim-pro-location-data-military-xmode/?ref=404media.co"><u>Muslims</u></a>&#x2014;and has led to both corporate and government action that have made doing this type of surveillance more difficult.&#xA0;</p><p>At 404 Media, we&#x2019;re continuing this work, as we&#x2019;ve promised to do from the beginning. We&#x2019;ve covered how the incoming vice president <a href="https://www.404media.co/internal-emails-reveal-how-hate-overwhelmed-springfield-after-trumps-lies-about-haitian-immigrants/"><u>spurred hate in a small town</u></a>. How <a href="https://www.404media.co/ai-maxers-thrilled-with-trumps-vice-president-pick-jd-vance/"><u>AI boosters helped cheerlead Trump back into office</u></a>. And how advertising, funded by tech billionaires, <a href="https://www.404media.co/this-is-exactly-how-an-elon-musk-funded-pac-is-microtargeting-muslims-and-jews-with-opposing-messages/"><u>micro-targeted and lied to voters</u></a> on the biggest social media platforms in the world, using divisive rhetoric. Not every story we do leads directly to positive impact, but many of them do. Our work has <a href="https://www.404media.co/civitai-and-octoml-introduce-radical-new-measures-to-stop-abuse-after-404-media-investigation/"><u>led to new moderation policies</u></a> that <a href="https://www.404media.co/microsoft-closes-loophole-that-created-ai-porn-of-taylor-swift/"><u>make it more difficult</u></a> to make nonconsensual AI porn (and <a href="https://www.404media.co/hacked-ai-girlfriend-data-shows-prompts-describing-child-sexual-abuse-2/"><u>child abuse imagery</u></a>), a <a href="https://www.404media.co/nvidia-sued-for-scraping-youtube-after-404-media-investigation/"><u>lawsuit against Nvidia</u></a> for building AI models on the back of other peoples&#x2019; labor and creative work; <a href="https://www.404media.co/mta-will-disable-omny-trip-history-feature-abuse/"><u>fixes in the New York subway system</u></a> to preserve privacy; <a href="https://www.404media.co/heres-the-pitch-deck-for-active-listening-ad-targeting/"><u>Google kicking a company</u></a> that claimed to be targeting adverts based on what people said near their smart devices from its platform (and <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-global-phone-spy-tool-patternz-nuviad-real-time-bidding/"><u>Google booting a global surveillance tool</u></a> from its ecosystem too); <a href="https://www.404media.co/youtube-deletes-1-000-videos-of-celebrity-ai-scam-ads/"><u>YouTube removing 1,000 videos</u></a> that were involved in an elaborate Medicare scam; <a href="https://www.404media.co/ai-generated-mushroom-foraging-books-amazon/"><u>Amazon taking down</u></a> dangerous AI-generated misinformation; and <a href="https://www.404media.co/discord-shuts-down-spy-pet-bots-that-scraped-sold-user-messages/"><u>shutdown a tool</u></a> that used for harassment that was scraping Discord en masse. We&#x2019;ve reported on what <a href="https://www.404media.co/nasa-bought-facial-recognition-tech-clearview-ai/"><u>surveillance technology U.S. government agencies have purchased</u></a>, and will continue this work as the Trump administration carries out its explicit plans for mass deportations.</p><p>We&#x2019;re faced again with an administration made up of people who explicitly want to ban porn, restrict women&#x2019;s healthcare, demolish reproductive rights and make it harder still to access sexual education. We followed these stories in Trump&#x2019;s first term, and in Biden&#x2019;s, too&#x2014;and we have no intention to slow down or stopping now that Trump&#x2019;s headed back to the White House. When Trump won in 2016, we weren&#x2019;t sure if our work mattered. Now we are sure that it does.</p>

It comes from the words <em>bihon</em>, <em>bichulsan</em>, <em>biyeonae</em>, and <em>bisekseu</em>, all of which start with a Korean prefix for &#x201C;no.&#x201D; It originated in 2019 in response to a culture that women felt was <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/4b-movement-feminism-south-korea.html?ref=404media.co"><u>patriarchal beyond repair</u></a>, and has since gained some traction in other countries.</p><p>But after Donald Trump won Tuesday&#x2019;s election, 4B has gone viral among women in the United States.

<img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2024/11/iphone-reboots.png" alt="Police Freak Out at iPhones Mysteriously Rebooting Themselves, Locking Cops Out"><p>Law enforcement officers are warning other officials and forensic experts that iPhones which have been stored securely for forensic examination are somehow rebooting themselves, returning the devices to a state that makes them much harder to unlock, according to a law enforcement document obtained by 404 Media.</p><p>The exact reason for the reboots is unclear, but the document authors, who appear to be law enforcement officials in Detroit, Michigan, hypothesize that Apple may have introduced a new security feature in iOS 18 that tells nearby iPhones to reboot if they have been disconnected from a cellular network for some time. After being rebooted, iPhones are generally more secure against tools that aim to crack the password of and take data from the phone.</p><p>&#x201C;The purpose of this notice is to spread awareness of a situation involving iPhones, which is causing iPhone devices to reboot in a short amount of time (observations are possibly within 24 hours) when removed from a cellular network,&#x201D; the document reads.&#xA0;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:95:"Reddit’s ‘Interesting as Fuck’ Community Rules That AI-Generated Video Is Not Interesting";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:116:"An AI-generated video of a cute parrot got thousands of upvotes before moderators removed it and locked the thread.
