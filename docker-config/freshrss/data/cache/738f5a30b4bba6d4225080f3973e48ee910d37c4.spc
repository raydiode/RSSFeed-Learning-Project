There is sometimes value in just getting a document out there. We did that back with <a href="https://www.404media.co/download-the-jeffrey-epstein-documents/"><u>the Epstein documents</u></a>, and published them so people had an easy way to find and download them themselves without having to navigate the U.S. court system. That, and I&#x2019;ve really done all I&#x2019;m interested in saying about the Snowflake hacker for a minute (mostly after <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-walls-are-closing-in-on-the-snowflake-hacker/"><u>The Walls Are Closing in on the Snowflake Hacker</u></a>). But I thought I&#x2019;d go through the indictment a bit more and pull out some sections to add some context.</p><p>One part says Moucka and Binns got access to &#x201C;billions of sensitive customer records, including individuals&#x2019; non-content call and text history records.&#x201D; Court records rarely name victim companies, but this is referring <a href="https://www.404media.co/hackers-steal-text-and-call-records-of-nearly-all-at-t-customers/"><u>to the AT&amp;T breach</u></a>. &#x201C;Drug Enforcement Agency (&#x2018;DEA&#x2019;) registration numbers,&#x201D; refers to the breach <a href="https://www.404media.co/hacker-breaches-pharma-giant-bausch-health-wants-to-extort-dea/"><u>I covered at Bausch Health</u></a>, where Judsiche (one of the handles allegedly used by Moucka) wanted to extort the DEA with that stolen information. The indictment also mentions financial information, payroll records, driver&#x2019;s license numbers, passport numbers, and Social Security numbers.&#xA0;</p><p>It says the hackers extorted at least 36 bitcoin, worth around $2.5 million at the time of payment.

This was very exciting not just because I was enjoying the dopamine of seeing a number go up, but because it was happening to many other people on Bluesky, too.&#xA0; </p><p>Over the last week, more than a million people have joined Bluesky and, more importantly, people who already had accounts there started actively using it again, to the point where it felt like the most energetic move away from Twitter since Elon Musk took over. Bluesky is different and, in my opinion, better than X and Threads because it is operated as a public benefit corporation and not owned by an oligarch. It is also decentralized and is federated, meaning it is moving toward a future where users &#x201C;own&#x201D; their audiences and can port them elsewhere (you can, and many do, argue about the details here, and about the differences between ActivityPub, which Mastodon uses, and the AT Protocol, which Bluesky uses).</p><p>The active migration away from social media networks that are owned, controlled by, and distorted by the richest men and most powerful companies in the world to a decentralized platform that is not owned and controlled by billionaires is one of the more hopeful things to happen in what has largely been a bleak year for the human internet as AI slop infects everything and billionaires put their thumbs on the scale of what we see on social media. The Bluesky migration is good news, and I hope it continues.</p><p>Bluesky feels more vibrant and more filled with real humans than any other social media network on the internet has felt in a very long time. It has surpassed Threads as the current most popular app on the App Store, and now has more than 15 million users overall.&#xA0;If you&apos;re on Bluesky, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonkoebler.bsky.social/post/3laok6tkyw222?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">you can follow all of us here</a>.</p>

<p><em>(We talk much more about Bluesky in the second half of this episode of the podcast)</em></p><p>Close followers of 404 Media may remember an article I did a year ago called &#x201C;<a href="https://www.404media.co/mastodon-is-the-good-one/"><u>Mastodon Is the Good One</u></a>,&#x201D; in which I put my eggs in the Mastodon basket. I am now taking most of those eggs (my attention and effort) and putting them in the Bluesky basket for a few different reasons, most notably the fact that Bluesky feels incredibly vibrant across a wide variety of topics. There are journalists and academics and scientists and Swifties and all the Brazilians who left X when Brazil temporarily banned it. Lots of people from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Twitter?ref=404media.co"><u>Black Twitter are there</u></a>. There are main characters on Bluesky and they are getting dunked on sometimes, and that&apos;s something I like. Importantly for me, many of my favorite baseball writers and accounts have made their way over to Bluesky and are actively posting there. It has, as they say, the juice.</p><p>I still think Mastodon is important and I will continue to use it, but a year after my article, I have complicated feelings about it. I still think that federation and decentralization, where publications and users &#x201C;own&#x201D; their followings and can port them across a variety of different services is the future of the internet if we want to have any hope of taking back any control from billionaires.  </p><p>I do not find Mastodon itself to be that difficult to use, and I find the people there to be very nice.&#xA0; I believe in decentralization and federation broadly speaking, and 404 Media will continue to support and hopefully be involved in attempts to disseminate our content more widely across the fediverse (it should be noted that Mastodon is not the only part of the fediverse, and that there are an increasing number of services that use ActivityPub). My Mastodon feed still has many interesting people talking, but I&#x2019;ve found it difficult to make a diverse and active feed that has a lot of posts about things that aren&#x2019;t technology, cybersecurity, open source, etc.&#xA0;</p><p>But something happened to many of the larger Mastodon servers over the last few months. I have a theory about this: Threads happened to it. Threads announced that it would become a part of the fediverse, and that it would allow people to share their Threads posts using ActivityPub.&#xA0;</p><p>The <a href="https://mastodon-analytics.com/?ref=404media.co"><u>website Mastodon-Analytics</u></a>, which tracks active users on Mastodon instances shows that the number of active users has steadily dropped over the last year, from 1.6 million in November, 2023 to a little less than 900,000 at the end of October. This cannot be fully blamed on Threads federating, but, anecdotally, Threads&#x2019;s uneven entry into the Fediverse feels like it has made my personal feeds deader. My theory and fear is that Threads has allowed people to perform the act of federating by having their Threads posts go to the fediverse, but it does not allow people on Threads to respond to people on Mastodon. This gives people a permission structure to abandon their Mastodon accounts, use Threads, and sort of passively invest in the future of decentralized social media while actually just giving more power to Mark Zuckerberg&#x2019;s side project.</p><p>This makes for what is at the moment a really bad dynamic, where you&#x2019;re broadcasting your Threads posts to the fediverse, and people on Mastodon can respond to them, but you can&#x2019;t respond to those people.</p><p>I talked about this on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SonR-X8Sg-I&amp;list=PLtZ3QXAltC7xfzOlf0dOM3cWEwvp75YUn&amp;index=1&amp;t=1106s&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>Dot Social podcast</u></a> with Flipboard&#x2019;s CEO Mike McCue and ProPublica&#x2019;s Ben Werdmuller, both of whom are extremely bullish on the future of the decentralized web, and they both told me that they think in the long run having a big fish like Threads investing in the fediverse will be good. Part of the whole point of the fediverse and decentralized social media is that it will ultimately not matter what server you&#x2019;re posting from.&#xA0;</p><p>But we are not quite at that point yet, in my opinion, because it still feels very difficult for me to build a feed on Mastodon where I feel like that is the only social media platform I can visit and where I am getting everything I need from that one place. Mastodon and ActivityPub still heavily overindexes on people talking about tech and nerdy internet topics (said lovingly), and it&#x2019;s hard to find active discussion about, say, sports, pop culture, celebrities, etc. In the short term, I think that Threads cannonballing in a partial way into the fediverse has cannibalized some of the energy that Mastodon has had over the last year, whereas Bluesky has been allowed to grow its own voice and userbase kind of on its own, without Zuckerberg jumping into the pool.&#xA0;</p>

<p>This article is nominally about Bluesky, but Threads and Mastodon are as much a part of the Twitter-replacement story as X and Bluesky itself are. (You should check out the episode of Dot Social where McCue <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5t427SRkvk&amp;list=PLtZ3QXAltC7xfzOlf0dOM3cWEwvp75YUn&amp;index=2&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>interviews Bluesky&#x2019;s primary owner and CEO Jay Graber</u></a>, by the way.)</p><p>Threads has also become more vibrant over the last few months, with Meta forcing people onto the platform by injecting Thread posts onto Instagram. This has led Threads to apparently add a million users a day, but it is not clear to me how real that userbase is, and how many of them are simply downloading Threads because they saw something on Instagram and are not regularly using the app or are just interacting with it when they see something on Instagram. </p><p>Threads still feels to me like a <a href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/threads-is-the-gas-leak-social-network?ref=404media.co"><u>gas leak social media network</u></a> with a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/threads-meta-engagement-rage-bait-viral-katie-notopoulos-i-tried-2024-9?ref=404media.co"><u>busted algorithm</u></a> that over indexes on extremely annoying middle managers in Silicon Valley who dogpile on anyone who thinks that maybe social media network that suppresses links and political content, has horrible and uneven content moderation, and is owned by the same company that is paying an army of posters in developing nations to spam their flagship platform with busted AI is maybe not the platform to bet on. It is also&#x2014;sorry&#x2014;full of people who think Threads is perfectly fine and do not want to do even the tiniest bit of work to take a microscopic bit of power away from a company that has dominated global social media to disastrous outcomes for 20 years, and who cannot be bothered to do the bare minimum amount of introspection or reading to understand why a viable platform not owned by Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk might be something worth building toward. </p><p>So, anyway. Bluesky. I am not going to pretend to be an expert on Bluesky&#x2019;s AT protocol, how it differs from ActivityPub (which Mastodon uses), and its future plans for interoperability. I know enough to know that if I attempt to explain it here, I will get something wrong and people will be mad at me. But I have been impressed with the tools that the open source development community is building to bridge the gap between the AT protocol and ActivityPub, and I&#x2019;m hopeful that some mixture of Bluesky and Mastodon will eventually serve most of my needs as a social media user and, hopefully, as someone who co-owns a website.&#xA0;</p><p>I do not know if this current enthusiasm will last. 404 Media&#x2019;s Sam Cole has endlessly made fun of my willingness to embrace new social media platforms and declare them to suddenly be where we should all focus our energy, and perhaps I will look back on this post and realize that I was naive or stupid.&#xA0;Cory Doctorow, who is perceptive about such things, <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/02/ulysses-pact/?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">worries about Bluesky enshittifying</a>, and its model of decentralization is not as robust at the moment as Mastodon&apos;s, which is certainly a concern. </p><p>But I do know that the energy on Bluesky is exciting, that the app and website are very usable, and that, as a journalist, I appreciate a platform that does not and says it will not punish links in any algorithm and which mostly operates in reverse chronological order. I think that the &#x201C;Starter Packs&#x201D; that let you follow tons of people at once according to your interests have made the onboarding process really easy. What&#x2019;s happening on Bluesky right now feels organic and it feels real in a way no other Twitter replacement has felt so far, and it feels better than X.com has been ever since Elon Musk took over. If the masses are going to move off Twitter, we can do much better than Threads. And we could do much worse than Bluesky.&#xA0;</p>

Both invested in $JENNER when it was on the Solana blockchain, and then when it relaunched on Ethereum, and both claim that had it not been for &#x201C;the false and misleading statements and omissions made by Jenner,&#x201D; they would not have invested in the memecoin. They also claim that similar members of the class bringing this complaint against Jenner didn&#x2019;t have the &#x201C;technical and financial sophistication&#x201D; to understand that they were being defrauded.</p><p>&#x201C;Because this type of digital asset is properly classified as a security under federal and California law, before offering $JENNER for sale to the public, Jenner was required to file registration statements with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and to comply with all federal and state securities laws, which she willfully failed to do,&#x201D; the complaint alleges.&#xA0;</p><p>It also claims that Jenner used her social media accounts, appearances on podcasts and other public statements to promote $JENNER, and has &#x201C;continuously, systematically, directly, and repeatedly touted $JENNER&#x2019;s ability to increase in value based on her managerial and entrepreneurial efforts, thereby manipulating the market and overall valuation of Jenner&#x2019;s own cryptocurrency, serving her own financial interests.&#x201D;</p><p>The complaint notes that Jenner &#x201C;solicited the help&#x201D; of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sahil-arora-banned-celebrity-memecoin-scams?ref=404media.co"><u>alleged crypto scammer to the stars Sahil Arora</u></a>, who has run several celebrity memecoin campaigns, including Floyd Mayweather, Offset, and Lindsay Lohan. Shortly after launching $JENNER, Jenner tweeted about Arora&#x2019;s involvement and ousted him from the project. She wrote, &#x201C;FUCK SAHIL! He scammed us! BIG TIME!&#x201D;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdVR-aKnyi5eX5HgiyWf8afU9Vbvsk5GAsUsN8Xq1rWCnp85H4qfhSvkU3Dl23nGU4QkF7gcb47yPYQMViv_mWfoTORNi_tWr934iK0uTyCHkhV2pyK0-sJ8Ct0Kj7cre3-NHpg7Q?key=lcJZ8h8H69isviGTlqabzF_H" class="kg-image" alt="&#x2018;Not a Scam &#x1F602;:&#x2019; Caitlyn Jenner Is Being Sued For Memecoin Securities Fraud" loading="lazy" width="544" height="296"></figure><p>&#x201C;Due to Jenner calling her own project and memecoin a &#x2018;scam,&#x2019; $JENNER&#x2019;s market capitalization rapidly plunged to $5 million as confusion ensued and Jenner issued no concrete explanation,&#x201D; the complaint says. &#x201C;Investor holdings began losing the majority of their value very rapidly.&#x201D; But Jenner wasn&#x2019;t done with $JENNER: she minted another memecoin with the same name on the Ethereum blockchain, and investors&#x2013;including the plaintiffs&#x2013;followed her there, too.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;Naturally, due to the confusion and now-competing memecoin on the Ethereum blockchain, the price of the Solana-based $JENNER began dropping despite Jenner, for a couple of days, continuing to promote it, as well, since she had accumulated her own Solana based $JENNER and was still hoping this token would increase in price,&#x201D; the complaint states.&#xA0;</p>

<p>The complaint comes a day after president-elect Donald Trump announced he would create the&#xA0; &quot;Department of Government Efficiency&quot; (DOGE), co-led by Elon Musk and named after a memecoin Musk heavily promoted. (Software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer invented DOGE in 2013 as a joke.) Jenner has been a strong supporter of Trump and Musk throughout this election; On November 6, <a href="https://x.com/Caitlyn_Jenner/status/1854282973949972850?ref=404media.co"><u>she tweeted a photo</u></a> of herself standing between them, with the caption &#x201C;Hope is back in America. These two men will single-handedly save western civilization and that starts with a strong United States of America. I am here and at your service and forever indebted to your sacrifice for this country. Let&#x2019;s Make America Great Again!&#x201D;</p><p>Jenner&#x2019;s stance on Trump&#x2019;s political career and capacity as a leader has been inconsistent throughout the years. In 2018, she said she was wrong to have supported Trump&#x2019;s run for president in 2016. &#x201C;The reality is that the trans community is being relentlessly attacked by this president,&#x201D; Jenner, who is herself transgender, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/caitlyn-jenner-i-thought-trump-would-help-the-lgbtq-community-i-was-wrong/2018/10/25/3c4cd61e-d86a-11e8-83a2-d1c3da28d6b6_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>wrote in the <em>Washington Post</em></u></a>. &#x201C;The leader of our nation has shown no regard for an already marginalized and struggling community. He has ignored our humanity. He has insulted our dignity. He has made trans people into political pawns as he whips up animus against us in an attempt to energize the most right-wing segment of his party, claiming his anti-transgender policies are meant to &#x2018;protect the country.&#x2019;&#x201D; In 2020, she said she <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/10/politics/caitlyn-jenner-dana-bash-interview/index.html?ref=404media.co"><u>skipped voting to play golf</u></a>. Earlier this year, <a href="https://x.com/Caitlyn_Jenner/status/1784604964742115796?ref=404media.co"><u>she tweeted</u></a> a video of her manager Sophia Hutchins giving the finger to re-electing Trump would &#x201C;restore world peace.&#x201D;</p><p>Jenner hasn&#x2019;t forgotten about her memecoin, despite being busy campaigning for Trump. &#x201C;Although the project has failed, trading volume is way down, and Jenner seems to have abandoned the hype,&#x201D; the complaint states, &#x201C;she did post about the project as recently as September of 2024, mocking a person who had lost their life savings investing in $JENNER, and still declaring, &#x2018;We aren&#x2019;t going anywhere.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf0_8McLYmYKMCmmhItyJ8LrCRJO9L_LAt3SrovdoBAhQexQAQxfKXpsuMiPfUbb7d0HM1aHf2Q0LD9voiZzSC1G3ENHFP-VNSQksTnVhslB_WoMYFk9nEHPdvvAwZOIPpXwPd_gg?key=lcJZ8h8H69isviGTlqabzF_H" class="kg-image" alt="&#x2018;Not a Scam &#x1F602;:&#x2019; Caitlyn Jenner Is Being Sued For Memecoin Securities Fraud" loading="lazy" width="399" height="364"></figure><p>&#x201C;Why would you put your life savings into a meme coin?&#x201D; she wrote on Twitter in response to someone saying &#x201C;I put my life savings into his coin.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p><em>Correction Nov. 15 2024: This article has been edited to accurately state the creators of DOGE. </em></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:98:"Pregnancy Tracking App âWhat to Expectâ Refuses to Fix Issue that Allows Full Account Takeover";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:160:"Vulnerabilities in the popular What to Expect app include one that allows a full account take over, and another that exposes that email address of forum admins.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:119:"https://www.404media.co/pregnancy-tracking-app-what-to-expect-refuses-to-fix-issue-that-allows-full-account-takeover-2/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"6734bfda2547650001bb7771";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"News";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Privacy";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 14:00:28 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Joseph Cox";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:7:"content";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:2:{s:3:"url";s:69:"https://www.404media.co/content/images/2024/11/what-to-expect-app.png";s:6:"medium";s:5:"image";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1107:"

It then told users there how to &#x201C;saut&#xE9; in butter&#x201D; a potentially dangerous mushroom, signaling again the high level of risk that AI chatbots and tools pose to people who forage for mushrooms.</p><p>404 Media has previously reported on the prevalence and risk of AI tools intersecting with the mushroom foraging hobby. We reported on <a href="https://www.404media.co/ai-generated-mushroom-foraging-books-amazon/"><u>AI-generated mushroom foraging books</u></a> on Amazon and the fact that <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-serves-ai-generated-images-of-mushrooms-putting-foragers-at-risk/"><u>Google image search</u></a> has shown AI-generated images of mushrooms as top search results. On Tuesday, the FungiFriend AI chatbot to the Northeast Mushroom Identification &amp; Discussion Facebook group, which has 13,500 members and is a place where beginner mushroom foragers often ask others for help identifying the mushrooms they have found in the wild. A moderator for the group said that the bot was automatically added by Meta and that &#x201C;we are most certainly removing it from here.&#x201D;&#xA0;Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The bot is personified as a bearded, psychedelic wizard. Meta recently began adding AI chatbots into specific groups, and has also created different character AIs.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfMivC0pfuVBAFe3fTIyK_CNzsskEbk8UpUSXtRmvumnal9f2KruQYwHjEEn9O8LIz2WpXUy0X14nM6MZOJR4yyhKAOfo571eKKdxaIFLx_QG74oYZOdBCEuaGJ9_igdFkkKCUf4g?key=iPgLEkaDcrcgjf2zheN33Oq8" class="kg-image" alt="AI Chatbot Added to Mushroom Foraging Facebook Group Immediately Gives Tips for Cooking Dangerous Mushroom" loading="lazy" width="624" height="591"></figure><p>Rick Claypool, research director for consumer safety group Public Citizen&#x2019;s president&#x2019;s office, told 404 Media about FungiFriend. Claypool has done important work about corporate capture of local and state governments, but is also an avid mushroom forager and has been documenting the risks of AI tools in mushroom foraging over the last few months. Over the summer, he wrote a <a href="https://fungimag.com/v17i2/v17n2-Claypool.pdf?fbclid=IwY2xjawGgXf9leHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHWyP2kCSwObFoWZZOwpQR-5JvpTRyH3kKLxy2gW9xZWcBFZXw_ba8nVtmw_aem_IsVbBP1kde1Olbx46fa_kQ&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>lengthy article in Fungi Magazine</u></a> that noted &#x201C;emerging AI technologies are being deployed to help beginner foragers identify edible wild mushrooms. Distinguishing edible mushrooms from toxic mushrooms in the wild is a high-risk activity that requires real-world skills that current AI systems cannot reliably emulate.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>One member of the Facebook group said that they asked the AI bot &#x201C;how do you cook Sarcosphaera coronaria,&#x201D; a type of mushroom that was once thought edible but is now known to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720330412?ref=404media.co"><u>hyperaccumulate arsenic</u></a> and has caused a documented death. FungiFriend told the member that it is &#x201C;edible but rare,&#x201D; and said &#x201C;cooking methods mentioned by some enthusiasts include saut&#xE9;ing in butter, adding to soups or stews, and pickling.&#x201D; The situation is reminiscent of <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-is-paying-reddit-60-million-for-fucksmith-to-tell-its-users-to-eat-glue/" rel="noreferrer">Google&apos;s AI telling people to add glue to pizza</a> or eat rocks on the advice of a Redditor named Fucksmith.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfH1kiLA4qG45e6VKb9TBrzp0PV8CDOeIAJpeoD9ne9dU1XLo5fzUw-NSBTLwdHDISWUIbV364CmUVGQn317if0fWcVjVQZ5XNZJe3fgFhgTHz7ErLn3j4U8ea-Q_yQKkaxgrDX1g?key=iPgLEkaDcrcgjf2zheN33Oq8" class="kg-image" alt="AI Chatbot Added to Mushroom Foraging Facebook Group Immediately Gives Tips for Cooking Dangerous Mushroom" loading="lazy" width="624" height="1191"></figure><p>Claypool told 404 Media in a phone call that it is &#x201C;really risky and reckless&#x201D; for Meta to add AI chatbots to groups like this. He said he has tested various AI tools to identify mushrooms and found &#x201C;there is just no way these things have reached a point of being good enough at providing true and factual and verifiable information, especially if we&#x2019;re talking about distinguishing between toxic and edible varieties.&#x201D;</p><p>Having a bot like this automatically added to a Facebook group full of humans who are dedicated in part to helping new foragers avoid accidentally poisoning themselves is particularly insidious. It also highlights the fact that Meta has very few guardrails on how it is injecting AI into its platforms.&#xA0;</p><p>Claypool said people use the group to post photos of mushrooms from their phones while they&#x2019;re in the field. Facebook added the &#x201C;FungiFriend&#x201D; chat as the first option in the group from mobile, meaning Facebook is pushing people to interact with AI, not other humans, on its supposed &#x201C;social network.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;These groups like this are wonderful for connecting people who are going out there in the field or have an emerging interest with connecting people who have a lot of experience who can help guide people away from dangerous stuff. If you are super new to this, there&#x2019;s a good chance you are asking questions about edibility, which is not where you should start,&#x201D; Claypool said. &#x201C;But if you&#x2019;re interacting with people in a group in public and someone gives not so great info, there&#x2019;s a chance there&#x2019;s multiple voices there [correcting it].&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>Conversations with an AI bot, meanwhile, take place in private and may be the first place that new foragers turn if they want to avoid asking what could be seen as a newbie or embarrassing question.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;Somebody who has any amount of knowledge is not going to be relying on the AI. It&#x2019;s going to be someone who feels nervous about putting themselves out there,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Maybe they&#x2019;re worried to seem like they don&#x2019;t know very much or they&#x2019;re afraid of asking a stupid question. So you ask the AI so it won&#x2019;t judge you like a normal person might. You might then not feel like it judges you, but it might kill you.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>

And then I knew like, &#x2018;Oh, that&#x2019;s a license plate reader.&#x2019; I started seeing them all over the place and realized that they were for the police. And I didn&#x2019;t like that.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>Flock is one of the largest vendors of automated license plate readers (ALPRs) in the country. The company markets itself as having the goal to <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/flock-ceo-eliminate-crime?ref=404media.co"><u>fully &#x201C;eliminate crime</u></a>&#x201D; with the use of ALPRs and other connected surveillance cameras, <a href="https://www.404media.co/researcher-who-oversaw-flock-surveillance-study-now-has-concerns-about-it/"><u>a target experts say is impossible</u></a>.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>In Huntsville, Freeman noticed that license plate reader cameras were positioned in a circle at major intersections, forming a perimeter that could track any car going into or out of the city&#x2019;s downtown. He started to look for cameras all over Huntsville and the surrounding areas, and soon found that Flock was not the only game in town. He found cameras owned by Motorola, and a third, owned by a company called Avigilon (a subsidiary of Motorola). Flock and automated license plate reader cameras owned by other companies are now in thousands of neighborhoods around the country. Many of these systems talk to each other and plug into other surveillance systems, making it possible to track people all over the country.&#xA0;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://deflock.me/?ref=404media.co"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">DeFlock</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Your car is being tracked.

I thought, &#x2018;Can I make a database of these license plate readers?&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p>And so <a href="https://deflock.me/?ref=404media.co#map=12/37.875190/-122.279819"><u>he made a map, and called it DeFlock</u></a>. DeFlock runs on Open Street Map, an open source, editable mapping software.

And I don&#x2019;t think I can change people&#x2019;s minds&#x2014;some people will be fine with it. But some people won&#x2019;t be,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;And hopefully enough people won&#x2019;t be fine with it and will do something to get them taken down [in their city] or at least better controlled, preferably taken down.&#x201D;</p><p>When I first talked to Freeman, DeFlock had a few dozen cameras mapped in Huntsville and a handful mapped in Southern California and in the Seattle suburbs. A week later, as I write this, DeFlock has crowdsourced the locations of thousands of cameras in dozens of cities across the United States and the world.</p><p>&#x201C;It still just scratches the surface,&#x201D; Freeman said. &#x201C;I added another page to the site that tracks cities and counties who have transparency reports on Flock&#x2019;s site, and many of those don&#x2019;t have any reported ALPRs though, so it&#x2019;ll help people focus on where to look for them.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-grey"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">&#x1F4A1;</div><div class="kg-callout-text"><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Do you know anything else about ALPRs or Flock?

He has also begun <a href="https://deflock.me/operators?ref=404media.co"><u>scraping parts of Flock&#x2019;s website</u></a> to give people a better idea of where to look to map them.

For example, all of the cameras in downtown Huntsville are pointing away from the downtown core, meaning they are primarily focused on detecting cars that are entering downtown Huntsville from other areas.&#xA0;</p><p>Freeman also said he eventually wants to find a way to offer navigation directions that will allow people to avoid known ALPR cameras. The fact that it is <a href="https://www.404media.co/lawsuit-argues-warrantless-use-of-flock-surveillance-cameras-is-unconstitutional/"><u>impossible to drive in some cities without being passing ALPR cameras</u></a> that track and catalog your car&#x2019;s movements is one of the core arguments in a Fourth Amendment challenge to Flock&#x2019;s existence in Norfolk, Virginia; this project will likely show how infeasible traveling without being tracked actually is in America. Knowing where they are is the first step toward resisting them.&#xA0;</p>

How did these objects grow so big so fast, becoming monsters just a billion years after the Big Bang? It&#x2019;s not an easy question to answer based on existing cosmological models.&#xA0;</p><p>For example, black holes theoretically shouldn&#x2019;t be able to consume matter at a higher rate than what&#x2019;s known as an Eddington limit, which is a measure of the maximum luminosity of an object. But the universe has a way of dispensing with &#x201C;shouldn&#x2019;t.&#x201D; Case in point: Scientists have now observed an ancient black hole named LID-568 that is devouring matter at 40 times its Eddington limit.&#xA0;</p><p>The discovery was made using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which observed LID-568 at 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang. Black holes are often invisible to telescopes, but LID-568 can be seen in X-ray light because it is an active galactic nucleus (AGN), a type of extremely luminous object powered by interactions between a black hole and the matter it consumes.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;This object is similar to other JWST-discovered faint active galactic nuclei populations, but is bright in X-ray emission and accreting at more than 4,000% of the limit at which radiation pressure exceeds the force of gravitational attraction of the black hole (that is, super-Eddington accretion),&#x201D; said researchers led by Hyewon Suh, International Gemini Observatory/NSF NOIRLab.</p><p>The team isn&#x2019;t sure how LID-568 is defying the rules out there, but it&#x2019;s possible that the gas outflows produced by this AGN are removing pressure from the system, allowing it to engorge itself on matter at a previously inconceivable rate. Or, perhaps, some other mechanism is responsible for this phenomenon. We just need to look at more of these early cosmic behemoths to figure out what&#x2019;s driving these sudden growth spurts.&#xA0;</p><p>In the meantime, LID-568&#x2019;s ravenous appetite suggests that black holes in the early universe can swiftly bulk up over a period of millions of years, producing gassy outflows that temporarily extinguish star formation in their host galaxies like candles on a birthday cake. The study calls this the &#x201C;blowout dusty red quasar phase&#x201D; which conveniently doubles as a description of the new political climate.</p><p>LID-568 is about 7 million times as massive as the Sun, which is still relatively small for an active galactic nucleus, but Suh and her team suggest that most of its mass was acquired during this &#x201C;single, super-Eddington accretion episode.&#x201D; That is a major piece of the puzzle for understanding why colossal black holes show up so early in the universe, and how their sudden growth sprouts affect star formation (among other processes) in their host galaxies.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;LID-568 could potentially represent the long-sought-after low-mass black hole undergoing rapid growth through super-Eddington accretion,&#x201D; the team said. &#x201C;This discovery showcases a previously undiscovered key parameter space and offers crucial insights into rapid black hole growth mechanisms in the early universe.&#x201D;</p><h2 id="this-is-your-brain-on-star-wars"><strong>This Is Your Brain on Star Wars</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(24)00726-8?ref=404media.co"><em><u>Rajimehr, Reza et al. &#x201C;Functional architecture of cerebral cortex during naturalistic movie watching,&#x201D; Neuron</u></em></a></p><p>Nothing is more relaxing than kicking back to watch a movie. But even as you unwind on the couch, your brain is working hard to process scenes with people, action, and dialog so that you can follow the plot.

These casts preserve victims killed in a pyroclastic flow of superheated ejecta that struck the town, leaving behind bodies that are eerily frozen in their dying forms.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>Scientists have now extracted DNA from these casts for the first time, and the results are full of surprises. Two adults locked in an embrace, often interpreted as sisters, turned out not to be, as at least one of them is male. An adult sitting with a child has been viewed as their mother due to a golden bracelet on their arm, but this person was also revealed to be a man who was unrelated to the child, hinting that modern biases were imposed on the bodies.</p><p>&#x201C;This study illustrates how unreliable narratives based on limited evidence can be, often reflecting the worldview of the researchers at the time,&#x201D; said researchers led by Elena Pilli of the University of Florence, adding that the &#x201C;discoveries challenge longstanding interpretations, such as associating jewelry with femininity or interpreting physical closeness as an indicator of biological relationships.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>Indeed, one takeaway I had from the study is that men wore cool jewelry in Pompeii, as another male victim was found with &#x201C;an iron ring with an engraved carnelian of a female figurine on the little finger of the left hand.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><h2 id="the-case-of-the-kinky-hose"><strong>The Case of the Kinky Hose&#xA0;</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)01371-X?ref=404media.co"><em><u>Urban, Lea et al. &#x201C;Water-hose tool use and showering behavior by Asian elephants,&#x201D; Current Biology</u></em></a></p><p>Finally, let&#x2019;s end this week with a cleansing shower. An elephant shower, that is! In what may be the most delightful study of the week, scientists observed Asian elephants at the Berlin Zoo using water hoses to rinse themselves in &#x201C;elegant and elaborate&#x201D; ways. They also witnessed a possible case of hose tampering as one elephant, Anchali, disrupting water flow while another elephant, Mary, was showering, by clamping and kinking the hose.</p><p>&#x201C;We were wondering whether Anchali purposefully interrupted the water flow going to the showering Mary or whether it was a side-effect of her playing and interacting with the water hose,&#x201D; said researchers led by Lea Urban of the Humboldt University of Berlin.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;Several strands of evidence suggest that Anchali was intentionally aiming to disrupt Mary&#x2019;s shower. (1) Anchali repeatedly showed this complex sequence of trunk maneuvers. (2) Disruptions of the water flow became more effective over time. (3) The hose had to be kinked and squeezed powerfully for disruptions to occur. (4) This occurred in close association with on-hose trunk stands. (5) There would have been a motive for Anchali to interfere with Mary&#x2019;s showering, as there were numerous aggressive acts by Mary toward Anchali. Taken together, these observations led us to suspect that Anchali&#x2019;s kink-and-clamp behavior could reflect a purposeful water-flow-abortion strategy and that the goal could be to sabotage Mary&#x2019;s showering.&#x201D;</p><p>Wow, Anchali, they&#x2019;ve got you dead-to-rights on five counts of shower sabotage. Will Mary seek revenge? Is there risk of escalation? I&#x2019;ll keep you all posted on any follow-up studies about this unfolding elephantine drama.</p><p>Until then, thanks for reading!

According to Nintendo, after his monetized YouTube channel was taken down, Keighin started adding a CashApp handle to his streams seeking donations from the audience.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcj_SBxAjepYjubd1vmotUgBxVeUAlhmvAlkxPRAeXsk7s5EaQU_YRTReis7moaVR3YvLo5c5USTWXAU-5eIvjY4fIYGxdVf2cj8QHGZOTUexjLDRJGBd6ClnyP0DZ2ahroGafq?key=ochq1zpnVL_AfA6NEmMwRZjY" class="kg-image" alt="Nintendo Sues Streamer of Emulated, Pre-Released Games" loading="lazy" width="624" height="147"></figure><p>According to Nintendo, on October 17, 2024, Keighin also told the company that he &#x201C;will actively help people find newer and updated copies of Ryujinx and Yuzu,&#x201D; two Nintendo Switch emulators the company that were taken down from GitHub this year after their creators were <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/switch-emulator-ryujinx-goes-offline-after-creator-gets-an-offer-from-nintendo-they-cant-refuse/?ref=404media.co"><u>contacted</u></a> by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/nintendo-is-suing-the-makers-of-the-switch-emulator-yuzu-claims-there-is-no-lawful-way-to-use-yuzu/?ref=404media.co"><u>Nintendo</u></a>. Keighin also said that he was helping people play Nintendo Switch games &#x201C;on their PC with no need to buy [Nintendo&#x2019;s] hardware,&#x201D; according to the lawsuit.</p><p>&#x201C;LOVE YA&#x2019;LL! CAPITALISM IS CANCER! MY CHANNEL IS BEING DELETED FOR SHARING GAMEPLAY VIDEOS! THIS IS YOUR REWARD!,&#x201D; Keighin said in one of the public posts sharing links to those emulators.&#xA0;</p><p>Of particular concern to Nintendo, it seems, is that Keighin wasn&#x2019;t just streaming emulated, pirated games, but that he was streaming Nintendo games before they were released.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;On at least fifty occasions in the last two years, Defendant has streamed gameplay footage of pirated copies of at least ten different Nintendo games without authorization&#x2014;all before those titles were released to the public,&#x201D; Nintendo said in the lawsuit. &#x201C;All of these streams were unauthorized and all compromise Nintendo&#x2019;s legitimate prerelease marketing. They also promote and encourage downloading of pirated copies of unpublished games. Defendant&#x2019;s streams often consist merely of him playing Nintendo&#x2019;s leaked games without commentary for extended periods of time.&#x201D;</p><p>As an example, Nintendo points to Keighin&#x2019;s streaming of <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> on YouTube and other platforms on October 22. <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership </em>is one of Nintendo&#x2019;s biggest games of the year, and it was officially released this Thursday, November 7.&#xA0;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2024/11/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Nintendo Sues Streamer of Emulated, Pre-Released Games" loading="lazy" width="1267" height="728" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/image.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2024/11/image.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2024/11/image.png 1267w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I could only find one active EveryGameGuru account at the time of writing. It included archives of previous streams, but not a stream of <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>, which appears to have been removed. That channel has only 43 followers. A screenshot in the lawsuit of one of Keighin&#x2019;s YouTube channels shows it had around 1,730 subscribers. Another screenshot in the lawsuit showing Keighin&#x2019;s Kick channel shows it only had one viewer at one point in time.&#xA0;</p><p>According to the lawsuit, Nintendo is seeking $150,000 per infringement of its copyright. Conservatively, going by Nintendo&#x2019;s claim that Keighin streamed pirated gameplay footage &#x201C;on at least fifty occasions in the last two years,&#x201D; he&#x2019;s looking at $7.5 million.</p>

I have a few leads I need to pick up but they require exactly the kind of focus I knew I wouldn&#x2019;t have, and everything in the news was understandably about the election. There have been years at Motherboard where we&#x2019;ve tried some counter-programming around elections and other all consuming news events, but these only work when they come about organically. You can&#x2019;t force it.&#xA0;</p><p>We&#x2019;ve talked here a few times in various ways about how we find stories. There are online communities we&#x2019;re embedded in, experts we check in with, and many times our best tips come from you, the reader. Sometimes, however, I find stories by asking myself: wait, are people nutting to this? And, of course, the answer is often yes, they are.&#xA0;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:4:"href";s:28:"https://www.404media.co/rss/";s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:19:"application/rss+xml";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:18:{s:3:"via";s:37:"1.1 varnish, 1.1 varnish, 1.1 varnish";s:6:"status";s:6:"200 OK";s:12:"content-type";s:34:"application/rss+xml; charset=utf-8";s:6:"server";s:9:"openresty";s:13:"cache-control";s:17:"public, max-age=0";s:4:"etag";s:37:"W/"14f9a-693ByVh8zQKQZh6qMGYEK6RUT/M"";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";s:4:"date";s:29:"Sat, 16 Nov 2024 06:05:01 GMT";s:3:"age";s:5:"39262";s:11:"x-served-by";s:67:"cache-ams2100113-AMS, cache-ams21024-AMS, cache-nrt-rjtf7700026-NRT";s:7:"x-cache";s:14:"MISS, HIT, HIT";s:12:"x-cache-hits";s:8:"0, 54, 1";s:7:"x-timer";s:26:"S1731737101.271772,VS0,VE6";s:4:"vary";s:6:"Cookie";s:12:"x-request-id";s:36:"0c2d1de0-dff8-44fd-8204-3af88fa94418";s:12:"ghost-fastly";s:4:"true";s:7:"alt-svc";s:5:"clear";s:14:"content-length";s:5:"85914";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20240924100504";s:5:"mtime";i:1731737102;s:3:"md5";s:32:"64c4ca0874bcf5598d2513646340db5f";}
