<p>Elon Musk, an original co-founder of OpenAI, attempted to keep the organization from becoming too cozy with Microsoft in an early cloud computing deal with the Redmond company.</p>



<p>&#8220;This actually made me feel nauseous. It sucks and is exactly what I would expect from them,&#8221; Musk wrote in a 2016 email thread with OpenAI&#8217;s Sam Altman, commenting on Microsoft&#8217;s proposal to provide $60 million in cloud computing credits for $10 million, a $50 million discount on their commercial value, if OpenAI also agreed to &#8220;evangelize&#8221; Microsoft Azure as its preferred cloud provider.</p>



<p>Altman responded, in part, &#8220;I had the same reaction after reading that section and they&#8217;ve already agreed to drop.&#8221;</p>



<p>Later, Musk was informed by Sam Teller, his chief of staff at the time, that Microsoft was willing to go forward with the agreement for a payment of $50 million from OpenAI without any evangelizing or other strings attached. </p>



<p>Musk wrote back that the revised proposal was fine by him, adding, &#8220;Would be worth way more than $50M not to seem like Microsoft&#8217;s marketing bitch.&#8221;</p>



<p>The emails predate, by a few years, the larger investment and partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI, which <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/microsoft-invests-1-billion-openai-vows-build-ai-technology-platform-unprecedented-scale/">began in September 2019</a>, after Musk had left OpenAI&#8217;s non-profit board. Microsoft has since gone on to invest nearly $14 billion in the San Francisco-based organization&#8217;s <a href="https://openai.com/our-structure/">capped-profit arm</a>, OpenAI Global LLC.</p>

<p>The 2016 email thread was disclosed publicly this week among a raft of exhibits in an amended version of Musk&#8217;s wide-ranging lawsuit against Altman and OpenAI. The new complaint added Microsoft as a defendant for the first time.</p>



<p>Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX founder who has been tapped by President-elect Trump to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-doge-trump-jobs-department-government-administration-rcna180210">target government inefficiency</a>, filed the original lawsuit against Altman and OpenAI earlier this year.</p>



<p>The amended complaint, filed Thursday in federal court in California, alleges that Microsoft is selling or giving away cloud computing to OpenAI &#8220;for the purpose of injuring competitors or destroying competition.&#8221; It accuses the companies of attempting to illegally monopolize the market for generative artificial intelligence. </p>



<p>Microsoft declined to comment on the lawsuit in response to a GeekWire inquiry.</p>



<p>The tech giant has provided OpenAI with cloud computing resources to train the massive AI models behind ChatGPT and other AI breakthroughs. </p>



<p>In turn, OpenAI&#8217;s technologies have helped to boost Microsoft&#8217;s own AI products. Microsoft said on its most recent earnings call that its overall AI revenue is on pace to exceed $10 billion annually.</p>



<p>Altman, the OpenAI CEO, has appeared at Microsoft events and press conferences over the past two years to promote their partnership and shared AI initiatives.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">From Mars Rovers to Cloud Computing</h3>



<p>Shams&#8217; journey to cloud entrepreneurship began in an unexpected place: NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. There, he worked on image processing for Mars rovers and communications for interplanetary missions. It was during this time that he first encountered Amazon Web Services (AWS), using his personal credit card to prototype solutions on the then-nascent cloud platform.</p>



<p>&#8220;I got to work on that,&#8221; Shams recalls. &#8220;I moved our entire image processing pipeline onto AWS, took advantage of the elasticity. There weren&#8217;t a lot of services in AWS back then, this is back in like 2008, 2009 time frame.&#8221;</p>



<p>This experience led Shams to join Amazon, where he eventually ran product and engineering for AWS media services. It was here that he identified the pain points in existing caching solutions that would later inspire Momento.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Simplifying Caching for Developers</h3>



<p>Momento&#8217;s core value proposition is simplicity. Shams explains, &#8220;If you need to do 10 million transactions per second, you don&#8217;t have to learn what instance type, the number of shards, the number of replicas, a lot of the knobs that you have to deal with with the traditional database.&#8221;</p>



<p>This approach resonates with developers who want to focus on building their applications rather than managing infrastructure and learning the nuances of managing infrastructure needed to power their applications. Momento collapses multiple components of a typical caching architecture into a single SaaS endpoint, handling scaling and optimization behind the scenes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Finding Focus in a Broad Market</h3>



<p>As a first-time founder, Shams admits to initial missteps in Momento&#8217;s go-to-market strategy. &#8220;I used to go around telling my team, we&#8217;re building a cache. A cache is like selling a water bottle, every vertical, every customer needs a cache,&#8221; he reflects. This led to a broad, unfocused approach that proved challenging for a small startup.</p>



<p>Momento has since refined its focus, targeting industries with unpredictable, spiky workloads where outages have significant financial impact. Media and entertainment, gaming, and certain areas of fintech have emerged as key verticals for the company.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Building a Culture of Customer Obsession</h3>



<p>Drawing from his Amazon experience, Shams emphasizes the importance of customer obsession at Momento. However, he&#8217;s careful not to simply transplant Amazon&#8217;s culture wholesale. &#8220;Momento has to define its own culture in its own unique ways,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We have the opportunity to start with a clean sheet of paper.&#8221;</p>



<p>This customer-centric approach extends to how Momento builds its product. The company actively seeks &#8220;design partners&#8221; — customers willing to provide feedback and collaborate on solving real-world caching challenges at scale.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Looking Ahead: AI and the Future of Infrastructure</h3>



<p>While Momento isn&#8217;t positioning itself as an AI company, Shams sees significant opportunities in supporting the infrastructure needs of AI applications. &#8220;As more AI applications are formed, the undeniable truth, the axioms that are always going to be true: people are going to want more interactivity, and that interactivity has to be fueled by the latest data,&#8221; he explains.</p>



<p>By focusing on providing fast, real-time data access, Momento aims to be a crucial enabler for the next generation of interactive, AI-driven applications.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lessons for First-Time Founders</h3>



<p>Reflecting on his journey, Shams emphasizes the critical importance of focus for early-stage startups. &#8220;Focused effort on everything from engineering to GTM just makes such a huge difference,&#8221; he advises. He encourages founders to identify a few key goals and align their entire team around those objectives.</p>

<p><a href="https://ast-science.com/">AST SpaceMobile</a> plans to use Blue Origin&#8217;s New Glenn rocket to launch some of the satellites for its space-based cellular broadband network in 2025 and 2026.</p>



<p>New Glenn has been under development at Jeff Bezos&#8217; privately held space venture <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2016/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-new-glenn-orbital-rocket/">for more than a decade</a>. Kent, Wash.-based <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/">Blue Origin</a> says the orbital-class rocket&#8217;s first launch is &#8220;on track&#8221; to take place this year at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.</p>



<p>Texas-based AST SpaceMobile is one of several satellite companies that have struck deals for New Glenn launches in advance of the rocket&#8217;s first mission.</p>



<p>“New Glenn’s performance and unprecedented capacity within its seven-meter fairing enables us to deploy more of our Block 2 BlueBird satellites in orbit, helping provide continuous cellular broadband service coverage across some of the most in-demand cellular markets globally,” Abel Avellan, AST SpaceMobile&#8217;s founder, chairman and CEO, <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/ast-spacemobile-selects-blue-origin-new-glenn">said in a news release</a>. </p>



<p>&#8220;It’s an honor to support AST SpaceMobile’s deployment of their next-generation BlueBird satellites, which will expand connectivity across the globe and positively impact many lives,” Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp said. “New Glenn is purpose-built for these kinds of innovative and ambitious missions.”</p>



<p>AST SpaceMobile&#8217;s BlueBird network is designed to operate directly with everyday smartphones and allow seamless switching between terrestrial cell towers and satellite signals, depending on location and coverage needs. The company&#8217;s strategic investors include AT&amp;T, Verizon, Google and Vodafone, and it&#8217;s said to have agreements with more than 45 mobile network operators globally.</p>



<p>The Block 2 BlueBirds have communications arrays that cover as much as 2,400 square feet when they&#8217;re unfolded, which would make them the largest commercial satellites ever deployed in low Earth orbit.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>AST SpaceMobile plans to use New Glenn as well as SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9 rocket and India&#8217;s GSLV rocket to deploy up to 60 satellites in the 2025-2026 time frame. Thanks to New Glenn&#8217;s super-sized fairing, each Blue Origin launch could send as many as eight Block 2 BlueBirds to low Earth orbit.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have now contractually secured orbital launch capacity during 2025 and 2026 to enable continuous cellular broadband service coverage of the AST SpaceMobile network,&#8221; the company&#8217;s president, Scott Wisniewski, said in a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241114979308/en/">news release</a>. He said AST Space Mobile was &#8220;well-positioned&#8221; to reach its goal of providing service to hundreds of millions of users around the world, and to the U.S. government.</p>



<p>AST SpaceMobile faces competition in the low-Earth-orbit satellite telecom market from SpaceX&#8217;s <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/tag/starlink/">Starlink network</a> (which has a <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/spacex-first-starlink-satellite-t-mobile-direct-cell/">cellular deal with T-Mobile</a>) and Eutelsat&#8217;s <a href="https://oneweb.net/">OneWeb network</a>. Next year, Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/tag/project-kuiper/">Project Kuiper</a> network is due to join the fray. For what it&#8217;s worth, Project Kuiper also has reserved New Glenn rockets, and SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9 rockets have been tasked with sending up satellites for Starlink, Kuiper and OneWeb.</p>

<p>And perhaps it further signaled some of the fatigue that could be settling in with Tesla and the company&#8217;s politically polarizing CEO, Elon Musk. As the company&#8217;s dominant U.S. market share <a href="https://caredge.com/guides/electric-vehicle-market-share-and-sales">finally dips</a>, new buyers appear to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/business/elon-musk-politics-tesla-sales.html">turned off by Musk</a>, and current owners are finding ways to <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91227963/anti-elon-tesla-bumper-stickers-amazon-best-seller">express their displeasure</a> as well.</p>

<p>The biggest buzz this weekend is sure to be around Volkswagen&#8217;s modern electric take on the classic peace, love and happiness van. It&#8217;s the first time the much-hyped vehicle has been available at an auto show in North America and I may have taken one of the first test drives.</p>


<aside class="callout clearfix" data-nosnippet><p><strong>PREVIOUSLY: <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/love-it-or-hate-it-tesla-cybertruck-turns-heads-in-seattle-as-geekwire-test-drives-futuristic-ev/">Love it or hate it, Tesla Cybertruck turns heads in Seattle as GeekWire test drives futuristic EV</a></strong></p>
</aside>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s got such a nostalgia about it,&#8221; Voelk said when asked what makes the Buzz buzzworthy. &#8220;People love the old microbus, but now it&#8217;s got this beautiful, modern design. They&#8217;ve done a great job with it.&#8221;</p>



<p>With a starting price around $60,000 and range of 260 miles, this isn&#8217;t a well-worn Vanagon struggling to make it over Snoqualmie Pass on a Sunday drive. The Buzz is immediately recognizable and it definitely turned heads during a short drive around the SoDo neighborhood.</p>

<p>The van is super roomy and sits up high, and there&#8217;s a ton of light coming in through the expansive moon roof. The acceleration is shocking, especially for a van with a lineage that includes slow-moving hippie buses.</p>



<p>&#8220;I keep looking at this and thinking, &#8216;If IKEA built a car,'&#8221; Voelk said from the passenger seat. &#8220;It has that quality and design, but yet, this is obviously not an Audi.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Buzz won&#8217;t eclipse Tesla — or iconic old VWs —&nbsp;anytime soon, especially in the U.S. There&#8217;s a long wait list and there&#8217;s only one factory in Germany making them for the entire world.</p>

<p>With over 300 miles of range, Voelk liked that the Equinox EV crossover is still affordable. With the federal tax credit, you can get a base model for under $30,000.</p>



<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t a tiny little car,&#8221; Voelk said. &#8220;This will seat five average-sized adults, relatively comfortably. People complained when [Chevy] took away the Bolt, but this is actually less expensive than the Bolt, and it&#8217;s larger. It&#8217;s more usable.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is the EV Americans want, in Voelk&#8217;s opinion.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a three row SUV crossover,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s roomy. You can actually put adults in the third row. It easily has a range of 260-270 miles in the real world. Also, if you&#8217;re traveling and you have access to a 350kw charger —&nbsp;Electrify America and EVgo — you&#8217;re looking at a charge from 10 to 80% in about 22 minutes. Which is pretty fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Voelk called this giant pickup the alternative to the Cybertruck.</p>



<p>&#8220;Frankly, I think this is a much, much better vehicle,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For starters, the range is over 400 miles on a charge. It&#8217;s incredible.&#8221;</p>



<p>The truck boasts generous front storage and an internal mid gate that opens to allow for loads of almost 11 feet. And it also has the &#8220;best tailgate in the business,&#8221; Voelk said. &#8220;No contest, in my opinion, this is the best electric pickup you can get.&#8221;</p>

<p>The loaded turbo electric model on display at the Seattle show is about $150,000, but price isn&#8217;t really an obstacle when you&#8217;re fantasy shopping.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is in every way a Porsche,&#8221; Voelk said. &#8220;It&#8217;s super fast. It handles really well. The battery pack is in the floor, which lowers the center of gravity. That&#8217;s what Porsche is all about. These things are awesome.&#8221;</p>

<p>Choo was previously Zillow&#8217;s senior vice president of real estate software. He joined the company nine years ago when it acquired San Francisco-based Trulia.</p>



<p>Choo has led multiple initiatives at the company, creating the Connections platform, Premier Agent market-based pricing and the Zillow Showcase product.</p>

<p>&#8212; <strong>Zillow </strong>on Thursday also shared additional leadership changes. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/susandaimler/"><strong>Susan Daimler</strong></a>, Zillow president, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattdaimler/"><strong>Matt Daimler</strong></a>, Zillow senior vice president of product, have resigned.</p>



<p>The Daimlers, who are married, co-founded Buyfolio, which was acquired by Zillow in 2012. They previously co-founded SeatGuru, which was bought by Expedia.</p>



<p>&#8220;When you’re barreling down the track at 100+ MPH and you love your crew and the ride has just the right mix of turns, dips, comfort and exhilaration, it’s nearly impossible to get off,&#8221; Daimler wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7262933596858986498/">LinkedIn</a>. &#8220;But after twelve years at Zillow the time is right to make the leap and embrace new adventures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8212; Identity verification startup <strong>Vouched </strong>named <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nealoman/"><strong>Neal Oman</strong></a> as chief technology officer.</p>



<p>Oman was previously CTO at Plunk, a Bellevue, Wash., home improvement tech startup.

<p>Founded in 2018, Vouched helps companies verify the identity of customers and users by examining driver’s licenses and other forms of identification. The Seattle-based company can provide fraud detection of a person in real-time.</p>



<p>&#8220;Vouched&#8217;s rapid growth presents an exciting opportunity to build new, AI-based products in the identity space and scale technical operations to seamlessly and reliably support our customer’s existing and emerging needs,” Oman said in a statement.</p>

<p>Fleming is a gynecologic oncologist. She&#8217;s joining Fred Hutch from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the largest U.S. cancer center.</p>



<p>Fleming was at MD Anderson for 13 years and is credited with playing a key role in growing the center&#8217;s regional cancer care, which is a priority for Fred Hutch.</p>



<p>“I have a real passion and love for women’s healthcare in general, but also for surgery, cancer treatment and research,” she said in a statement.</p>



<p>Fleming will split her time between overseeing daily operations at Fred Hutch&#8217;s outpatient clinic in South Lake Union and providing care for patients.</p>



<p>The Fred Hutch has been expanding its patient care services following a merger two years ago with Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. The new arrangement created a single institution that combined research and patient care and also serves as University of Washington Medicine’s cancer program.</p>

<p>The extraordinary pace of Microsoft&#8217;s ascent is what stands out in retrospect. </p>



<p>The company, which is marking its 50th anniversary next year, was well on its way to dominating its industry by the time it arrived in the Seattle region from Albuquerque in 1979. Seven years later, in March 1986, the company made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, at a market value of more than $500 million. </p>



<p>So what can be learned from a fresh look at Microsoft&#8217;s startup years?</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the question at the heart of <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/a-new-look-at-microsofts-startup-story-with-insights-for-today-microsoft-50-chapter-2/"><strong>the second chapter in our Microsoft @ 50 series</strong></a>. Our research and interviews with key players show how the company&#8217;s bet on a market that didn&#8217;t really exist at the time — personal computer software — paid off in ways that its founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen never imagined. </p>



<p>One of the experts who put this story in context for us was historian <a href="https://history.washington.edu/people/margaret-omara">Margaret O’Mara</a> of the University of Washington, whose book,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/534709/the-code-by-margaret-omara/"><em>The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America</em></a>,&nbsp;chronicles the rise of the modern tech industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This special GeekWire Podcast episode features highlights from my conversation with O&#8217;Mara, in addition to a first-hand account from the company&#8217;s first outside investor and longtime board member, David Marquardt. </p>



<p><strong>Listen below, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/a-new-look-at-microsofts-startup-story-with-insights-for-today-microsoft-50-chapter-2/">read the full story here</a>, and continue reading for highlights from O&#8217;Mara&#8217;s comments, edited for context and clarity. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Microsoft&#8217;s decision to focus on software</strong>: Software was not an industry. Desktop computing didn&#8217;t even exist at the start of the &#8217;70s. They were able to latch onto this nascent industry, when it isn&#8217;t even an industry. &#8230; But they also were charging for something that in the hobbyist community was being given away for free. And that was novel —  they were, again, on the ground floor, one of the very, very first enterprises doing that. </p>



<p><strong>The early approach: </strong>On the one hand, it&#8217;s getting on the launchpad as the rocket ship&#8217;s about to go off, but also being pretty aggressive and elbowing competitors aside, and being quite aggressive and making sure that you&#8217;re first to it. And then famously striking a deal with IBM that not only gets the IBM PC business, but also is a platform that can be cloned and it isn&#8217;t a closed ecosystem, so it just creates this market that turns out to be globally dominant.</p>



<p><strong>The advantage of their upbringing:</strong> They&#8217;re different than some of the other startup founders who are really coming with few connections and just a brash attitude and a willingness to do what it takes. &#8230; I don&#8217;t think that detracts from what they accomplished. There are plenty of people who had plenty of privilege and didn&#8217;t do it. [Their privilege] didn&#8217;t build what they built, but that does set them apart. &#8230; This is a useful lesson for founders, then and now: success does come with support of more mainline institutions, and the new economy grows on old-economy foundations.</p>

<p><strong>The importance of the team:</strong> Microsoft is Paul and it&#8217;s Bill and it&#8217;s Steve [Ballmer], but it&#8217;s also so many other people who were there at the ground floor and were there in the early years who built it. The technical people and non-technical people, and an ecosystem, a Seattle ecosystem, a broader tech industry ecosystem, that enabled them to do what they did. And that&#8217;s a super-important lesson for any founder, any startup leader, to remember that it&#8217;s about much more than just you. Having your cast of thousands both in and outside the company is really important.</p>



<p><strong>The move to Seattle: </strong>Moving up here was choice not only to come home, but also to get something of a competitive advantage in the job market for programmers. If they had been down in California, they would&#8217;ve been competing with a lot of other startup companies. And up here, there were some startup companies, but not quite as many. And there was obviously the engineering workforce around the University of Washington.</p>



<p><strong>The roots of gender bias:</strong> Very quickly, as it starts growing — and it grows fast in those early years here in Seattle — there&#8217;s a certain work culture that is very hard-charging. &#8230; There was not a big emphasis on work-life balance. Historically, that&#8217;s one of the things that has driven a lot of women out of technical roles in the tech industry over time, where you have this relentless and very male-coded and male-dominated culture that is all about work and doesn&#8217;t give a lot of flexibility for caregiving or other things outside of work. </p>



<p><strong>Long-term role in the region: </strong>Greater Seattle has always been a company town. First it was timber, then it was Boeing, and then it&#8217;s Microsoft and tech, but really Microsoft. It was Microsoft&#8217;s town for a very long time, even after Amazon was established and was growing. It&#8217;s only in the last decade and change that it&#8217;s been Microsoft and Amazon&#8217;s town, that Amazon&#8217;s taken such a central role in our political economy and our regional conversation. But Microsoft has done so much to define what this place is for 50 years.</p>

<p><a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/%7Egshyam/">Shyam Gollakota</a>, a University of Washington computer science professor and Seattle-based health tech startup founder, won a $100,000 award as one of six researchers honored as part of this year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.infosysprize.org/">Infosys Prize</a>. </p>



<p>The annual award is organized by the Infosys Science Foundation, a charitable arm of Indian multinational company Infosys. </p>



<p>Gollakota won this year&#8217;s prize for <a href="https://www.infosysprize.org/laureates/2024/shyam-gollakota.html">engineering and computer science</a>. </p>



<p>&#8220;This was surprising since I did not know I was on their radar,&#8221; Gollakota told GeekWire. </p>



<p>Gollakota&#8217;s research spans a variety of areas, including wireless tech, battery-free devices, WiFi sensing and imaging, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/meet-hacker-professor-whos-saving-lives-smart-devices-sonar/">medical diagnostics via smartphones</a>, and more. He leads the Mobile Intelligence Lab at the UW&#8217;s Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering.</p>



<p>Gollakota co-founded&nbsp;Sound Life Sciences, a UW spinout that developed an app to monitor breathing that was <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2022/exclusive-google-quietly-acquired-a-seattle-digital-health-startup-that-built-an-app-to-monitor-breathing/">acquired</a> by Google in 2022. </p>



<p>He&#8217;s also the co-founder of <a href="https://wavelydx.com/">Wavely Diagnostics</a>, which uses a smartphone app to detect ear infections.</p>



<p>More recently Gollakota has been leading research <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/11/14/ai-headphones-sound-bubble-noise-cancelling/">on a headphone prototype</a> that uses AI to create a &#8220;sound bubble&#8221; and can <a href="https://soundbubble.cs.washington.edu/">learn the distance for each sound source in a room</a>. He said he&#8217;ll use his award money from the Infosys Prize to help commercialize the technology.</p>



<p>&#8220;I do think this prize supports our work on creating a symbiosis between humans, hardware, and AI to create superhuman capabilities like sound bubbles, with the potential to transform billions of headphones, AirPods, and improve the lives of millions of people who have hearing loss,&#8221; Gollakota said. </p>



<p>The Infosys Prize, launched in 2008, goes to Indian researchers and innovators in fields including economics, engineering &amp; computer science, humanities &amp; social science, life sciences, mathematical sciences, and physical sciences. Those based outside of India are required to spend 30 days at a host institute in India. </p>



<p>The only previous U.S. recipient of the award for computer science was Hari Balakrishnan in 2020.</p>



<p>This year year the Infosys Prize began limiting winners to 40 years of age.</p>



<p>Gollakota recently spoke on the Shift AI podcast, which you can check out below. </p>

<p>A week or more to get a bunch of stuff I don&#8217;t really need? Sign me up! </p>



<p>With <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/amazon-launching-discount-storefront-amazon-haul-with-items-under-20-longer-delivery-times/">the debut of Amazon Haul</a> in beta form this week, we&#8217;re finally getting a glimpse of the company&#8217;s long-awaited response to Temu and Shein, the discount e-commerce platforms for the TikTok generation that have turned online shopping into something that feels more like playing a game.</p>



<p>Everything is less than $20 (much less, for the most part) and items arrive in one to two weeks, going completely against the grain of the company&#8217;s larger push for faster and faster shipping times.</p>



<p>From a business perspective, it&#8217;s a sector that the Seattle-based e-commerce giant could no longer ignore. With Temu&#8217;s U.S. e-commerce market share<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/amazon-launches-haul-to-sell-sub-20-products-to-compete-with-temu-shein-7ee9b3b7?mod=Searchresults_pos2&amp;page=1"> projected by eMarketer</a> to grow from 0.7% this year to 2.3% next year, Haul seems like an obligatory experiment for Amazon, at least, and maybe a critical long-term move.</p>



<p>For now, Amazon Haul is mobile-only. The best way to access it, in my experience, is to search for &#8220;Haul&#8221; in the search bar in the Amazon app. It&#8217;s filled with the tricks of the trade from this e-commerce genre, with playful language encouraging you to buy enough for free shipping, and more nudging after that for additional discounts.</p>



<aside class="callout clearfix"><h4>RELATED STORY</h4><a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/amazon-launching-discount-storefront-amazon-haul-with-items-under-20-longer-delivery-times/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon launching discount storefront ‘Amazon Haul’ with items under $20, longer delivery times</a></aside>



<p>As a member of Generation X, I&#8217;m probably not in the target demographic. (OK, definitely not.) I&#8217;ve glanced at Shein and Temu in the past, never actually ordered. I&#8217;m not a regular TikTok user, let alone an aficionado of TikTok Shop. </p>



<p>That said, I&#8217;m a longtime Amazon customer and Prime subscriber, like much of the U.S. population, so maybe I&#8217;m representative of the company&#8217;s opportunity to introduce these concepts to its larger customer base. </p>



<p>Here are my off-the-cuff thoughts after my first Amazon Haul experience.</p>



<p><strong>This is a lot of crap.</strong> Scrolling down the list of items such as $4.99 wrist straps for weightlifting, $4.99 silicon dish drying mats, $2.73 oval shoelaces for sneakers, and $2.99 decorative outdoor solid throw pillow covers, it felt like rooting through abandoned items in the back of a warehouse — which might not be that far off.</p>



<p>My cart had lots of &#8220;lonely vibes&#8221; for a while while I tried to identify enough items that I would actually use to reach the $25 minimum needed for free shipping.</p>



<p>I ended up using the search bar to find items such as a $1.99 six-pack of adjustable cable organizers, an $8.79 pair of mesh zipper pouches for office supplies, a $3.99 desktop cell phone stand, a $6.99 small screwdriver set, and a $5.99 electronic cable organizer and accessories carrying case.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="753" height="451" src="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-14-095630.png" alt="" class="wp-image-848884" srcset="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-14-095630.png 753w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-14-095630-630x377.png 630w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, that was quite a haul!</strong> OK, I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;m not immune to the dopamine that comes from treating shopping as entertainment. Looking at my cart, I was starting to see the appeal. My subtotal was $27.75, and the grand total after tax was $30.62, with a promise to arrive sometime between Nov. 21 and Nov. 25.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t remember buying five different items for $30 on Amazon in the past. And it&#8217;s kinda fun to know that I&#8217;ve got various products arriving in a week or so. I&#8217;ll probably forget what I ordered in the meantime, making the experience more along the lines of receiving a surprise gift from myself.</p>



<p>With no small amount of guilt about the implications of modern consumerism, and recognizing my contribution to the demise of humanity, I could envision making a monthly (or weekly?) Amazon Haul order if the browsing experience was more tailored to me, and it wasn&#8217;t so tough to find items that I would want to buy.</p>



<p>Which leads to my last big takeaway &#8230; </p>



<p><strong>Amazon Haul isn&#8217;t yet leveraging the company&#8217;s biggest strengths.</strong> The beta of Amazon Haul is largely disconnected from the existing Amazon shopping experience, as of now. The company clearly isn&#8217;t using what it knows about me and my buying/browsing history to target items to me that I&#8217;d be more inclined to like.</p>



<p>From the outside, given all the company&#8217;s expertise in e-commerce, this seems like a trivial enhancement to make, and one that could dramatically change not only the experience of using Amazon Haul but also the volume of orders.</p>



<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;m looking forward to trying out that cell phone stand and adjustable cable cords in the next week or so. I&#8217;ll post an update about the receiving experience after I get my first Amazon Haul.</p>

<p><a href="https://prenuvo.com/">Prenuvo</a>, providers of full-body MRI screenings designed to detect cancer and other diseases early, announced the opening and location of its first clinic in Seattle on Thursday.</p>



<p>The clinic will be located at 4610 25th Ave. NE, in the University Village shopping mall near the University of Washington.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/prenuvo-bringing-its-celebrity-endorsed-full-body-mri-scanning-to-new-seattle-clinic-in-2024/">First announced</a> last December, the location is Prenuvo&#8217;s first in the Seattle area. The Silicon Valley company has more than a dozen locations across the U.S. and Canada, with plans for at least 10 more, including in Portland, Ore.</p>



<p>Prenuvo is part of a health trend around venture-backed startups offering whole-body MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans to identify various conditions. Prenuvo competitor Ezra <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/inside-the-controversial-world-of-full-body-health-scans-we-tested-a-vc-backed-mri-service/">recently opened</a> its own location in the Seattle region.</p>



<p>These companies cite <a href="https://ezra.com/community">anecdotal</a> <a href="https://www.prenuvo.com/stories">stories</a> about people who credit these scans for spotting something that needed medical attention.</p>



<p>But some medical experts worry that the scans can add unnecessary costs and concerns — more information about your body could be less helpful than it sounds, they say.</p>

<p>Prenuvo’s machine is called an open bore MRI scanner, which permits the head to be outside of the magnet for portions of the scans. After a scan, images are reviewed by one of the company’s licensed radiologists. Patient results are typically ready in about 10-to-15 days.</p>



<p>Every report includes explanations and insights into the risk level and actions recommended, as well as a physician-focused, shareable PDF report.</p>



<p>Priced at $2,500 for a 60-minute full-body scan, Prenuvo&#8217;s procedures have attracted high-profile clientele and celebrity endorsements, including from the likes of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvszJqGyfqr/">Kim Kardashian</a>.</p>



<p>“Seattle’s commitment to wellness and proactive health make it an ideal location for Prenuvo’s clinic,” Prenuvo founder and CEO Andrew Lacy said in a statement. “Our goal is to help Seattle residents take charge of their health by offering a way to detect potential risks early, empowering them to live fuller lives with more confidence and peace of mind.”</p>



<p>Founded in 2018, Prenuvo has raised more than $70 million.</p>

<p>Microsoft and NASA have joined forces to develop Earth Copilot, a software tool that uses artificial intelligence and cloud computing to simplify the process of searching and analyzing Earth science data.</p>



<p>The collaboration is part of NASA&#8217;s <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/tops/">Transform to Open Science Initiative</a>, which aims to make more than 100 petabytes of satellite imagery and other Earth science data more readily available to scientists, educators, policymakers and the general public.</p>



<p>“The vision behind this collaboration was to leverage AI and cloud technologies to bring Earth’s insights to communities that have been underserved, where access to data can lead to tangible improvements,” Minh Nguyen, Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft, said today in a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/14/from-questions-to-discoveries-nasas-new-earth-copilot-brings-microsoft-ai-capabilities-to-democratize-access-to-complex-data/">blog posting about the project</a>. “By enabling users to interact with the data through simple, plain language queries, we’re helping to democratize access to spaceborne information.”</p>



<p>Tyler Bryson, Microsoft&#8217;s corporate vice president for U.S. health and public sector industries, said Earth Copilot lets users interact with NASA&#8217;s data repository conversationally.</p>



<p>Bryson noted that the sheer scale and complexity of the information gathered for NASA&#8217;s <a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/about">Earth Science Data Systems Program</a> can sometimes make finding the right information a daunting task. Earth Copilot doesn&#8217;t require users to navigate highly technical interfaces or master the intricacies of geospatial analysis.</p>



<p>&#8220;Instead, they can simply ask questions such as &#8216;What was the impact of Hurricane Ian in Sanibel Island?&#8217; or &#8216;How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect air quality in the U.S.?'&#8221; Bryson said. &#8220;AI will then retrieve relevant datasets, making the process seamless and intuitive.&#8221;</p>

<p>The project leverages <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/tag/microsoft-azure/">Microsoft&#8217;s Azure cloud platform</a> and the customizable capabilities of <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service/">Azure OpenAI Service</a>.</p>



<p>“Azure’s robust suite of services, including machine learning, data analytics and scalable cloud infrastructure, powers this AI prototype,” said Juan Carlos López, a former NASA engineer who is now an Azure Specialist at Microsoft. “We’ve designed the system to handle complex queries and large datasets efficiently, ensuring that users can quickly find the information they need without getting bogged down by technical complexities. Our goal was to create a seamless, scalable solution that could evolve as NASA’s data, tools and applications grow.”</p>



<p>Earth Copilot is currently being tested by NASA researchers to explore its capabilities. After the platform is evaluated and fine-tuned, the <a href="https://impact.earthdata.nasa.gov/">NASA IMPACT team</a> will look into making it part of its Visualization, Exploration and Data Analysis Project &#8212; <a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/tools/veda">also known as VEDA</a>.</p>

<p>The company is led by CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yunhaojiao/">Yunhao Jiao</a>, a former engineer at Amazon and a natural language processing researcher.</p>



<p>TestSprite, which graduated from Techstars Miami earlier this year, has 12 employees and plans to double headcount. </p>



<p>Investors include Techstars, Jinqiu Capital, MiraclePlus, Hattrick Capital, EdgeCase Capital Partners, and angel investor Rafael Barroso.</p>



<p>&#8220;Automated testing is becoming more crucial as AI assisted software development rapidly becomes the de-facto way of building software in a market that is pushing for faster, more efficient software delivery from software engineers,&#8221; said Andres Barreto, managing director at Techstars. &#8220;We believe the Testsprite team and product is poised to become the leader in this new market shift.&#8221;</p>

<p>Members of the Seattle City Council&#8217;s Select Budget Committee on Wednesday debated a newly proposed 2% capital gains tax to support food and housing programs for the city&#8217;s low- and middle-income residents. </p>



<p>Response so far is mixed from Seattle&#8217;s elected officials, as well as from the tech and business community. </p>



<p>Many leaders question the need for more revenue when the outcomes from current spending on these programs are unclear.</p>



<p>Some also raise concerns about possible detrimental impacts to the business industry and retention of tech talent, but supporters of the tax push back on assertions that the policies harm a region&#8217;s innovation ecosystem. The state previously passed its own 7% capital gains tax that sparked controversy within the Seattle tech sector.</p>



<p>The new proposal comes as the City of Seattle is hashing out its 2025-2026 budget, with Mayor Bruce Harrell calling for $8.3 billion in spending. That includes a $270 million hole in the city&#8217;s general fund, which helps pay for public safety, administration, education and human services, arts and culture, and other programs.</p>



<p>There are worries that budget shortfalls could grow in the future, particularly as some expect the incoming Trump administration will be disinclined to provide federal support for a city that&#8217;s often vilified by conservative voices.  </p>

<p>City councilmember <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/council/moore">Cathy Moore</a> is leading the charge on the proposed capital gains tax. </p>



<p>Moore, chair of the city&#8217;s Housing and Human Services Committee, said there are growing unmet needs for Seattle&#8217;s financially vulnerable residents. Revenue from the tax would fund initiatives that help people pay rent, assist with housing down payments, and provide food assistance.</p>



<p>Moore acknowledged the need for more data about the impact of existing programs, but said residents are struggling now. </p>



<p>&#8220;People&#8217;s income is not keeping up with the cost of living,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not keeping up with rents, not keeping up with food, utilities. We live in a very expensive city, and we live in a city in which the income inequality is continuing to grow at a rapid pace.&#8221;</p>



<p>Income inequality in Seattle <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/income-inequality-grew-in-seattle-since-the-pandemic-new-data-shows">has grown</a> since the pandemic, and median wages for the city&#8217;s tech workers reached record highs last year, according to the <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/earnings-for-seattle-tech-workers-hit-record-high/">Seattle Times</a>.</p>



<p>Fellow councilmembers shared Moore&#8217;s concerns, but not all were sold on the new tax, which is being offered as a budget amendment.</p>



<p>Councilmember Rob Saka called the proposal &#8220;the right idea at the wrong time” as the city needs to take a closer look at why current efforts aren&#8217;t delivering hoped-for results.   </p>



<p>“People don’t mind paying their fair share,&#8221; Saka said. &#8220;But people do have a strong problem with doing that if they&#8217;re not seeing any return on investment for their existing tax dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>The new tax would likely impact a subset of tech employees and entrepreneurs.</p>



<p>While anyone can invest in stocks, employees at larger companies can receive stock options as part of their compensation package —&nbsp;also known as “golden handcuffs” that help retain employees if the options vest slowly over time.</p>



<p>Employees at startups, meanwhile, often get a stake in a business —&nbsp;equity that could be lucrative if the company is later acquired.</p>



<p>The Washington Technology Industry Association (WTIA) has raised questions about the proposed tax, which could bring in between $16 million and $51 million per year, according to city data.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellyfukai/">Kelly Fukai</a>, WTIA’s chief operations officer, said the wide range of potential revenue &#8220;does not help the city reliably fund programs&#8221; and added that &#8220;a further expansion of the capital gains tax warrants more discussion.&#8221;</p>



<p>The WTIA opposed the state&#8217;s capital gains tax when it passed in 2021.</p>



<p>Seattle Chamber of Commerce President and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-smith-5900034">Rachel Smith</a> also wants more information.</p>

<p>“We simply do not believe that the case has been made that the city needs to raise taxes right now,” she told GeekWire in an interview Tuesday. Smith noted that the city&#8217;s revenue has been steadily increasing, and she echoed Saka&#8217;s concerns that the results from existing  programs bear closer scrutiny.</p>



<p>The chamber is also concerned about keeping the city economically competitive. Smith said most businesses don&#8217;t make decisions based on a single data point such as one tax, but when they look at opportunities for growth and attracting talent “there are a lot of inputs into that, and the tax environment &#8230; is one of those.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devore">Chris DeVore</a>, founding managing partner at Seattle venture capital firm <a href="http://www.founderscoop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Founders&#8217; Co-op</a>, downplayed the connection between taxes and tech innovation.</p>



<p>&#8220;California is one of the highest tax burden states in the country, and also happens to be the dominant market for software startups and VC finance,&#8221; DeVore said via email. &#8220;So no, I think tax policy has very little to do with the quality of innovation in any given location, as much as wealthy&nbsp;anti-tax advocates may wish to conflate the two.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://sociology.cornell.edu/cristobal-young">Cristobal Young</a>, an associate professor of sociology at Cornell University, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/nov/20/if-you-tax-the-rich-they-wont-leave-us-data-contradicts-millionaires-threats">investigated</a> whether millionaires move to avoid increased income taxes. </p>



<p>&#8220;Top earners are established in their careers, married,&nbsp;have kids in school, own their homes, make good money, and have little reason to move,&#8221; he said via email. &#8220;They have much lower migration rates than lower-income earners, who are still searching for their economic place in life.&#8221;</p>



<p>Young cited tax records that show a &#8220;small but non-zero effect on elite migration&#8221; when taxes go up for wealthy individuals.</p>



<p>If income taxes increase by 1%, about 0.1% of top taxpayers move away, while others remain, according to his research. </p>



<p>&#8220;Would a capital gains tax change this story?&#8221; Cristobal said. &#8220;It would&nbsp;raise the tax rate a bit more &#8212; but add resources for social&nbsp;services that&nbsp;help people get to a better&nbsp;place. The endless question is whether a new program &#8212; trying to help people &#8212; is worth its cost.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young&#8217;s book, &#8220;<a href="https://www.sup.org/books/sociology/myth-millionaire-tax-flight">The Myth of the Millionaire Tax Flight</a>&#8220;, published in 2017.</p>



<p><a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/taxing-the-rich-the-effect-of-tax-reform-and-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-tax-flight-among-u-s-millionaires/">Research</a> from Young in 2022 noted that “once pandemic restrictions arrived, households began questioning the value of living in expensive, high-tax states.&#8221; Tax data shows a clear rise in migration out of high-tax states, especially among higher-income earnings, Young wrote, adding that &#8220;diminished embeddedness raised the tax-flight cost of taxing the rich.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/jeff-bezos-move-out-of-washington-state-sparks-questions-about-wealth-taxes/">pointed</a> to Washington&#8217;s capital gains tax after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-you-will-always-have-a-piece-of-my-heart-jeff-bezos-leaving-amazons-hometown-for-miami/">announced</a>&nbsp;in November 2023 that he was leaving his longtime hometown of Seattle, where Amazon is based, and moving to Miami. </p>



<p>Bezos has sold billions of dollars of Amazon stock since making the move to Florida, which does not have a capital gains tax.</p>



<p>In an Instagram post announcing the move, Bezos said he wanted to be closer to his parents and Blue Origin operations in Florida. He did not mention taxes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A smaller version of a statewide tax</h3>



<p>To cover the current revenue gap in the general fund, the mayor will tap Seattle&#8217;s Payroll Expense Tax, also known as JumpStart. The historically controversial tax targets payrolls at the city’s largest companies, including tech giants such as Amazon. The tax was originally earmarked for addressing homelessness, equitable economic development, and environmental programs.</p>



<p>Moore proposed the capital gains tax as a source of added revenue that won&#8217;t burden lower-income residents the way a regressive sales tax does, for example.  </p>



<p>Her pitch follows last week&#8217;s General Election in which Washington voters <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/washington-state-voters-reject-initiatives-that-aimed-to-repeal-capital-gains-tax-and-climate-programs/">showed overwhelming support</a> for retaining the 7% statewide capital gains tax that funds education.</p>



<p>The city tax would be implemented at a lower rate, but with otherwise identical language that limits its scope and applies only to profits that exceed a certain threshold, which last year was $262,000. Based on state tax filings from this year, the city version would have impacted 816 taxpayers.</p>



<p>The tax would come into effect in 2026, with revenue first collected in 2027. </p>



<p>Opponents to the state capital gains tax challenged it in court, alleging that it was an income tax and not allowed under state law. The Washington state Supreme Court upheld the tax last year, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal.</p>



<p>Moore noted that the tax has survived the legal process and the ballot. &#8220;It&#8217;s a solid form of additional revenue, and &#8230; has broad public support,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>A Harrell spokesperson <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattle-council-member-proposes-capital-gains-tax-at-city-level/">last week said</a> the mayor currently does not support the tax, but is open to discussion. </p>



<p>Former councilmember Alex Pedersen <a href="https://council.seattle.gov/2023/06/07/release-councilmember-pedersen-launches-bold-tax-reform-to-make-the-system-more-fair-for-seattle/">proposed</a> a similar 2% capital gains tax last year.</p>



<p>There are 164 proposed amendments to the city budget, and the committee will begin voting on them starting tomorrow and finishing Tuesday.</p>

<p>Tukwila, Wash.-based <a href="https://www.starfishspace.com/">Starfish Space</a> today announced that it has raised $29 million to support the development of its first three Otter orbital servicing vehicles for missions serving the U.S. Space Force, NASA and Intelsat. </p>



<p>The investment round was led by Shield Capital, a San Francisco venture capital firm specializing in advanced technologies in fields ranging from space to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. Other major participants in the round include new investors such as Point 72 Ventures, Booz Allen Ventures, Aero X Ventures, Trousdale Ventures and TRAC VC, plus existing investors such as Munich Re Ventures, Toyota Ventures, NFX and Industrious Ventures.</p>



<p>Initial word of the funding round came in September, in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1886318/000188631824000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">regulatory filing</a> and a <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/starfish-space-fresh-funding-otter/">GeekWire report</a>. At the time, Starfish declined to comment on the investment or the investors. Today, Starfish co-founder Austin Link hailed the fresh infusion of capital in a <a href="https://www.starfishspace.com/press-release/starfish-space-secures-29-million-in-new-funding-to-advance-otter-development/">news release</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;This new round of funding is a pivotal moment in the journey of Starfish Space, as it will allow us to launch the first Otter satellites to orbit,” Link said. “These first Otters will change what is possible when it comes to operating satellites in space. We are excited to partner with an outstanding group of investors to make these missions happen, and proud of the growing support we’ve received from existing investors as part of this round.”</p>



<p>Starfish&#8217;s Otter spacecraft is designed to rendezvous with satellites in orbit to inspect them and link up with them, either for servicing or for safe disposal. The system makes use of several innovative technologies, including Starfish&#8217;s Cetacean and Cephalopod navigation and docking software systems and the Nautilus orbital capture mechanism.</p>



<p>Link and Starfish&#8217;s other co-founder, Trevor Bennett, founded the company in 2019 after working at Jeff Bezos&#8217; Blue Origin space venture. Since then, Starfish has built up its workforce to 70 employees and has raised a total of $50 million in venture capital funding, including the current investment round.</p>

<p>Last year, Starfish launched a scaled-down prototype known as Otter Pup for orbital testing. Although the test <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/starfish-space-scrubs-otter-pup-satellite-rendezvous/">encountered a series of challenges</a>, the <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/starfish-satellite-rendezvous-d-orbit/">results</a> encouraged the Starfish team as well as investors.</p>



<p>“On-orbit satellite servicing is a critical evolution to unlock the next level of value for defense and commercial space,” Letitia &#8220;Tish&#8221; Long, newly appointed Starfish Board member and senior adviser at Shield Capital, said in today&#8217;s news release. “Austin, Trevor and the whole Starfish team have proven their ability to execute complex missions on orbit, and we are excited to be partnering with them as they deliver Otter for critical customer applications.”</p>



<p>Starfish has a <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/space-force-and-starfish-space-lay-out-their-roadmap-for-satellite-docking-mission/">$37.5 million contract with the U.S. Space Force</a> to execute a first-of-its-kind mission that involves having the full-scale Otter dock with and maneuver national security assets in geostationary Earth orbit.</p>



<p>The company has also <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/starfish-space-contract-intelsat-satellite-servicing/">signed a contract with Intelsat</a> to provide on-orbit life extension services to a geostationary satellite beginning in 2026, and has been put in charge of a <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/starfish-space-15m-nasa-sspicy-satellite-inspection/">$15 million NASA mission</a> aimed at inspecting multiple U.S.-owned defunct satellites in orbit, beginning in 2027.</p>



<p>Those three missions will make use of the Otter spacecraft supported by the new funding round.

<p><strong>Bill Gates needed a coat.</strong></p>



<p>It was November 1980. Ronald Reagan had just defeated Jimmy Carter in the U.S. presidential election. Barely 25 years old, Gates had been running Microsoft for five years with his childhood friend Paul Allen. Steve Ballmer, the future Microsoft CEO, had joined a few months earlier as “Assistant to the President.”</p>



<p>Microsoft had grown to about 50 people since moving to Bellevue, Wash., from Albuquerque in 1979. The IBM Personal Computer was a year away from hitting the market, and Microsoft was scrambling to come up with a 16-bit operating system — what would become MS-DOS — for a computer that would emerge as a defining machine of the PC revolution.</p>



<p>Gates was deep in the code, and the business, and not the smaller details of life or the weather. The brisk fall day caught him by surprise when he showed up for a University of Washington game at Husky Stadium in a t-shirt.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.augustcap.com/team/david-marquardt/">David Marquardt</a> offered Gates his sportcoat, and the rest is history.&nbsp;</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://omny.fm/shows/geekwire-podcast/microsoft-s-startup-story-a-new-look-with-insights/embed?style=cover&#038;image=1&#038;description=1&#038;download=1&#038;playlistImages=1&#038;playlistShare=1&#038;share=1&#038;subscribe=1&#038;background=f5f5f5&#038;foreground=94381d&#038;highlight=cb4d28" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write" width="100%" height="180" frameborder="0" title="Microsoft’s startup story: A new look, with insights for today"></iframe>



<p>A tech investor with a background in mechanical engineering — and a regular at Silicon Valley’s legendary Homebrew Computer Club — Marquardt had already met with Ballmer to start exploring the possibility of investing in the company. As a follow-up, Ballmer set up a meeting between Marquardt and the Microsoft co-founder in the Gates family’s seats at the football game.</p>



<p>“We really didn&#8217;t watch much of the game,” Marquardt recalled in a recent interview. “He spent a lot of time [writing] on the back of the program, outlining his compiler architecture and what he was doing with the company. It was a very technical first meeting — not a lot of small talk.”</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="600" src="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/david-marquardt.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-848655" style="width:300px" srcset="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/david-marquardt.jpg 600w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/david-marquardt-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/david-marquardt-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/david-marquardt-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/david-marquardt-200x200.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">David Marquardt was Microsoft&#8217;s first outside investor, and a board member for 33 years. (August Capital Photo)</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Around that time, Microsoft’s annual profit was $2 million to $3 million, on about $5 million in revenue. Technology Venture Investors (TVI), where Marquardt was a junior partner, later became Microsoft’s first outside investor, putting in $1 million for a 5% stake.</p>



<p>“So it was a $20 million valuation, which everyone told me, that&#8217;s ridiculous, paying four times revenues for a software company,” Marquardt said. “Anyway, it worked out.”</p>



<p>It sure did. Five years and a few months after that football game, on March 13, 1986, Microsoft went public on the New York Stock Exchange, closing its first day of trading at a market value of more than $500 million. The company is worth more than $3.1 trillion today.</p>



<p><strong>For this second chapter in our <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/special-coverage/microsoft-at-50/">Microsoft @ 50 series</a>, GeekWire spent the past month revisiting Microsoft’s early years</strong>, from its founding in 1975 to its IPO in 1986, exploring some of the same questions we consider in our startup coverage today. What made the company a success? What was the key to its business model? What were its biggest challenges and mistakes?</p>



<p>We interviewed former employees and others from that era, dug through our own reporting archives, and found long-lost nuggets in books and historical records, with a little help from AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For starters, that scene at the football game offers an insight for modern-day startup investors. Note that Marquardt wasn’t pushing Gates about business growth, or the path to an IPO, like other venture capitalists were at the time. As an engineer and early believer in PCs, he was genuinely interested in the technical nuances of what Microsoft was building at the time.</p>



<p>“We spoke the same language,” Marquardt recalled. “We kind of hit it off.”</p>



<p>But what else defines Microsoft’s startup story? Here are our takeaways.</p>



<p><strong>Microsoft targeted a nascent market with huge potential.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Focus defined this startup. It wasn’t just Bill Gates’ ability to focus intensely on code, to the point that he often neglected to comb his hair or grab a coat. It was also Microsoft’s overall focus on software as a business.</p>



<p>As a company launching at the dawn of the PC revolution, Microsoft could have gone into the business of making computers. But software was a more natural course, considering the expertise that Gates and Allen had developed starting out as kids at Lakeside School in Seattle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was also a savvy business move, making Microsoft’s total addressable market equal to the broader world of personal computers. It began with their BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800, the machine that Paul Allen spotted on the cover of the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics magazine. And it took off with the proliferation of PCs, thanks to a non-exclusivity clause in the IBM contract that let Microsoft sell MS-DOS to other PC makers.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“That not only gets it the IBM PC business, but it also is a platform that can be cloned — and it isn&#8217;t a closed ecosystem,” said <a href="https://history.washington.edu/people/margaret-omara">Margaret O’Mara</a>, a University of Washington historian whose book, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/534709/the-code-by-margaret-omara/"><em>The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America</em></a>, chronicles the rise of the modern tech industry. “So it just creates this market that turns out to be globally dominant.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Publicly, Microsoft’s vision was, “A PC on every desk and in every home.” Inside the company, of course, people would add the phrase, “running Microsoft software.”</p>



<p>Over the decades, Microsoft has expanded into hardware, from the Microsoft Mouse to modern-day Microsoft Surface computers, and even <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-maia-for-the-era-of-ai-from-silicon-to-software-to-systems/">its own data center processors</a> for training and running AI models. But this early focus on software set the company apart.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The company had the courage to defy conventional wisdom.</strong></p>



<p>“Few people even thought there would be a distinct software industry,” Gates wrote in the book <em>Inside Out</em>, published by Microsoft on its 25th anniversary. &#8220;We believed that computing power would be cheap, that there would be computers everywhere made by lots of different companies, and that software would be needed to take advantage of these trends.”</p>



<p>It might seem like a no-brainer today. But in the early years, it wasn’t at all clear that the bet on software would work out. Microsoft struggled at times to pay the bills — going so far as to borrow $7,000 in 1977 from a new hire, Bob Greenberg, to help make ends meet, as documented in <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Gates/Stephen-Manes/9780671880743"><em>Gates</em></a>, the 1993 book by Paul Andrews and Stephen Manes.</p>



<p>“Just like a lot of startups, we were really early in a lot of things, but found ways to navigate through and persevere long enough, and eventually it all caught up,” said Steve Wood, an engineer who joined Microsoft in 1976, in a recent interview.</p>



<p>At times, it seemed as if the company had to bring the market into existence by sheer force of will, as demonstrated by Gates’ landmark&nbsp; <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Bill_Gates_Letter_to_Hobbyists_ocr.pdf">“Open Letter to Hobbyists.&#8221;</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full-width"><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Bill_Gates_Letter_to_Hobbyists_ocr.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="630" height="580" src="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-13-092122-630x580.png" alt="" class="wp-image-848659" srcset="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-13-092122-630x580.png 630w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-13-092122.png 725w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gates&#8217; &#8220;Open Letter to Hobbyists&#8221; from 1976.

<p>“As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software,” Gates wrote, describing the work that went into writing, documenting, improving, and expanding the footprint of Microsoft BASIC. “Hardware must be paid for, but software is something to share. Who cares if the people who worked on it get paid? … Is this fair?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Questions about software as a business persisted for years, even after Microsoft found traction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before investing in 1981, Marquardt faced skepticism from his partners, who had avoided backing software startups based on an economic theory of marginal pricing. Because the cost of producing another copy of a software program was effectively zero, this theory went, competition would push prices toward zero, as well, leaving little room for profits.</p>



<p>“And I didn&#8217;t believe that,” Marquardt said. “I thought the value was going to be in software, because that was going to be the bridge that was going to bring the masses — at least businesses at first, then eventually the masses — into the personal computer. So I got pretty excited about Microsoft, but it was a bit of an uphill battle to convince my partners to invest.”</p>



<p><strong>Microsoft&#8217;s founding duo had complementary skills.</strong></p>



<p>A common pattern among startup founders is sometimes described as the “dreamer/doer” or “hacker/hustler” pair. The combo of Steve Jobs (hustler) and Steve Wozniak (hacker) of Apple may be the best-known example from that era, but there are many others, as well.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="630" height="494" src="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/gates-allen-modern.png" alt="" class="wp-image-848656"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Paul Allen and Bill Gates recreated their classic photo in 2013. (Living Computers Museum Photo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Microsoft’s two founders fit this mold, with a slight caveat: Allen and Gates were both programmers with innate abilities to code and deep understanding of technology. But Gates was inclined to apply his ambitions to business, as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his second meeting with the Microsoft co-founder, Marquardt was struck by the fact that Gates seemed to know Microsoft’s competitors better than they knew themselves.</p>



<p>Allen was a student of the tech industry, in his own way, but he also pursued a variety of interests outside of work — immersing himself in science fiction and honing his guitar skills — ultimately achieving something closer to what we would call work-life balance today.</p>



<p>Wozniak and Allen had a lot in common, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2017/microsoft-co-founder-paul-allen-meets-apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-first-time-ever/">as they discovered</a> during an event at Allen’s Living Computers Museum in Seattle in April 2017, less than two years before Allen’s death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Woz and Paul had never met. They bonded completely, and spent the night talking to each other,” recalled <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/lazowska">Ed Lazowska</a>, the longtime University of Washington professor, who arranged for Wozniak to attend. “The reason was, they were on the same side of that equation.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Microsoft&#8217;s early years were marked by a hard-charging, argumentative, and at times dysfunctional culture.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Entire books have focused on this topic, perhaps most notably<em> </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Drive-Making-Microsoft-Empire/dp/0887306292"><em>Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire</em></a><em>, </em>by James Wallace and Jim Erickson, published in 1992, which offered many outsiders their first accounts of screaming matches inside the company.</p>



<p>Gates so frequently declared an idea the stupidest he’d ever heard that longtime Microsoft executive Paul Maritz <a href="https://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/no-bull-bill-gates-blunt-legacy-1277370.php">would tell people</a> not to worry, &#8220;because they weren&#8217;t going to hold the record for long.” Gates was also fond of saying that a piece of software was the worst piece of code he’d ever seen, and he could do it in 200 lines of BASIC over the weekend.</p>



<aside class="callout clearfix"><h4>ALSO IN THIS SERIES</h4><a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/ai-dreams-microsoft-50-chapter-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Dreams: Microsoft @ 50, Chapter 1
</a></aside>



<p>This mindset translated into Microsoft’s larger approach, which ultimately contributed to the business activities that led to the landmark U.S. antitrust case against the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The story of Microsoft’s early days is one of “getting on the launch pad as the rocket ship’s about to go off, but also being pretty aggressive in elbowing competitors aside — quite aggressive,” said O’Mara, the author and historian.</p>



<p>In addition, O’Mara noted, Microsoft&#8217;s early culture and approach reinforced and contributed to gender biases and homogeneity in the tech industry, which has had lasting impacts.</p>



<p>Relentlessness and vision are important, but the “high-octane, super combative culture” is not the right blueprint for startups today, O’Mara said. Yelling matches and arguments are “not necessary to build and ship great products or be an iconic tech company.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, Microsoft has evolved and matured over the years in this regard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s also critical, O’Mara said, to recognize the importance of the larger team and the role of the broader community and tech ecosystem in Microsoft’s success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gates did have a knack, at times, for tempering his temper with a sense of humor. Speaking with him for <a href="https://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/no-bull-bill-gates-blunt-legacy-1277370.php">a 2008 newspaper interview</a>, on one of his last days in the office before leaving his day-to-day role at Microsoft, I observed that he seemed to have mellowed over the years.</p>



<p>“Bullshit,” he responded, laughing.</p>



<p><strong>Gates had a tendency to downplay Microsoft&#8217;s potential.</strong></p>



<p>For all his ambition about software, and his belief in the future of the personal computer market, Gates preferred to keep the bar low when envisioning Microsoft’s potential, at least in his communications with others. This characteristic stands out in today’s startup world, when entrepreneurs might feel more inclined to talk in big terms about their prospects.</p>



<p>“It’s a funny thing — I think our dreams were a lot more modest,” Allen told me in a 2005 interview, reflecting on Microsoft’s growth on the company’s 30th anniversary. “We used to talk about how we might have dozens of employees back when we first wrote BASIC and brainstormed about having our own company, back in Boston.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marquardt recalled Gates once developing a formula to prove that a software company couldn’t have more than $10 million in revenues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gates continued this approach when it came time for Microsoft’s IPO.</p>

<p>“Bill was the only CEO I can ever remember who argued with the bankers to get the price down. He thought the valuation was ridiculously high,” Marquardt said. “He lived in this world of fear, like the world is coming to an end. You know, ‘Linux is going to kill us, Lotus is going to kill us.’ And they all had an opportunity to, but we managed to prevail.”</p>



<p>His competitive nature helps to explain this mindset.</p>



<p>“He always wanted to exceed expectations,” Marquardt said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In its product development, however, Microsoft was frequently willing to go out on a limb — exemplifying the ethos of “fake it till you make it” in its promises to deliver BASIC to Altair maker MITS and MS-DOS to IBM, for example, before it had really started either piece of software.</p>

<p><strong>Microsoft had a strong sense of place.</strong></p>



<p>This may seem like an anachronism in today’s world of remote and hybrid work, but location was critical for Microsoft from the beginning — first its decision to locate in Albuquerque near MITS, and later its move to the Seattle region, where Allen and Gates grew up.</p>



<p>“Moving up here was a choice not only to come home, but also to get something of a competitive advantage in the job market for programmers,” O’Mara said. “If they had been down in California, they would have been competing with a lot of other startup companies.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were startups in Seattle at the time, but not as many as in Silicon Valley. The move also allowed the company to tap into the pool of engineering talent emerging from the UW, from what is now known as the <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/">Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering</a>.</p>



<p>Microsoft first moved to Bellevue, Wash., before landing in its permanent location in nearby Redmond, where a massive campus redevelopment is still in progress.</p>



<p><strong>The company capitalized on disruptions in technology.</strong></p>



<p>Marquardt, Microsoft’s first outside investor, went on to co-found August Capital in 1995, and served on Microsoft’s board for 33 years, from 1981 until 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Throughout its history, he said, Microsoft has seen its greatest success when it has taken advantage of “discontinuities in technology,” starting with the rise of the personal computer.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you look at it from an economic point of view, the only way that you can increase wealth and prosperity and reduce poverty, etc., is through increases in productivity,” he said. “Microsoft, through all these different generations, has figured out how to make people way more productive. … I think that&#8217;s the revolution that Microsoft drove from very early days.”</p>



<p>And they weren&#8217;t done yet. In early 1986, as Microsoft prepared for its initial public offering, the company’s IPO prospectus signaled another disruption on the way — describing the recent release of a “graphical operating environment which runs on the Microsoft MS-DOS operating system.”</p>

<p>Amazon is launching a new storefront aimed at delivering a wide range of products priced $20 and under as the e-commerce giant faces increased pressure from discount retailers such as Shein, TikTok Shop and Temu.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=122341379011">&#8220;Amazon Haul&#8221;</a> — a mobile only experience available on Amazon&#8217;s shopping app and its mobile website — will feature fashion, home, lifestyle, electronics and other products.</p>



<p>While Amazon has outpaced competitors with faster and faster delivery times, including one-day and same-day delivery for Prime members, typical delivery times for Amazon Haul items will be one to two weeks.</p>



<p>“Finding great products at very low prices is important to customers, and we continue to explore ways that we can work with our selling partners so they can offer products at ultra-low prices,” said Dharmesh Mehta, vice president of Worldwide Selling Partner Services at Amazon, said in a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/affordable-products-amazon-20-dollars-and-under">news release</a> Wednesday.</p>



<p>Amazon said it will screen the products sellers offer in Haul for safety and authenticity, and that all items are covered by the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/amazon-guarantee-backs-all-products-purchased-in-store">A-to-z Guarantee</a>, for products that are damaged, defective, or not as described.</p>



<p>The Haul shopping experience features a dedicated search, cart, and checkout. Items are priced $20 or less with the majority priced $10 and under, and some items as low as $1, according to Amazon.</p>



<p>Free returns are offered on all Haul purchases over $3.00 within 15 days of delivery.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/13/amazon-haul-discount-storefront-debuts-to-take-on-temu-and-shein-.html">CNBC reported</a> that Amazon is able to offer low prices through Haul by importing each item directly from manufacturers in China.</p>



<p>Shein has grown to become one of the leading online destinations for trendy, low-priced fashion items favored by young shoppers. The Singapore-based company, along with TikTok parent ByteDance, recently <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/another-fast-fashion-giant-plants-flag-in-amazons-backyard-as-shein-opens-bellevue-office/">grabbed office space</a> in Amazon&#8217;s backyard in Bellevue, Wash.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobcrimmins">Bob Crimmins</a> just wanted to play some poker.</p>



<p>The longtime Seattle entrepreneur created <a href="https://startuphaven.com/">Startup Haven</a> back in 2006 to get founders and investors in a room together around a table to enjoy a meal and a game.</p>



<p>Nearly two decades later, Startup Haven is still going strong with more than 2,500 members across 18 cities, including two abroad. </p>



<p>This week the group announced its latest expansion: <a href="https://startuphaven.com/shhq/">a new partnership</a> with the Columbia Tower Club and The Collective in Seattle to establish a physical &#8220;headquarters&#8221; of sorts for Startup Haven members that will provide access to special events, member breakfasts, and daily co-working access.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the latest milestone in a journey Crimmins certainly did not expect when the veteran software engineer and University of Washington philosophy grad first started organizing poker games.</p>



<p>&#8220;I really thought poker was this remarkable platform for building relationships, just because of the dynamics of the game and the way it works,&#8221; Crimmins said. </p>



<p>Startup Haven poker games started in Seattle and soon spread to other cities. Crimmins led the organization in his spare time as he juggled other startup endeavors and advisory roles. It was a passion project that lost money each year but provided fulfillment for Crimmins in the countless connections formed from the events. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full-width"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="630" height="356" src="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20180522_203509-630x356.png" alt="" class="wp-image-848564" srcset="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20180522_203509-630x356.png 630w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20180522_203509-768x434.png 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20180522_203509.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A game of poker is a regularity at Startup Haven events. (Startup Haven Photo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>More than a decade after launching Startup Haven, Crimmins saw an opportunity to tap into the growing network of founders and investors.</p>



<p>He began focusing full-time on Startup Haven in 2019 and soon launched a <a href="https://startuphaven.com/startup-haven-fund/">Startup Haven Fund</a> after meeting so many founders as they were just launching their companies. &#8220;It struck me as a very unique pipeline for a fund,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Crimmins raised $4.5 million for the first fund. He typically writes checks in the $100,000-to $300,000 range in pre-seed rounds for early stage startups across the world. </p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had a really terrific bunch of companies that have done really well so far,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Startup Haven also runs an <a href="https://startuphaven.com/accelerator/">accelerator</a> that aims to share some of Crimmins&#8217; learnings from advising and mentoring companies over the years.</p>



<p>But the community groups in each city that play poker and gather for other events — and will use the physical spaces — is still core to Startup Haven, which now has active chapters in Reykjavik and London.</p>



<p>Startup Haven remains rooted in Seattle, where it all began 19 years ago. Crimmins considers it a testing ground for new ideas, such as the new physical &#8220;headquarters&#8221; space. </p>



<p>He considers the city &#8220;one of the best places on Earth to start a company.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Seattle is entering a phase where there&#8217;s been enough success and learnings that we&#8217;re doing better than we ever have,&#8221; he said of the city&#8217;s startup ecosystem. </p>



<p>He said it&#8217;s key to create spaces like Startup Haven or the newer group <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/inside-the-new-serendipity-factory-trying-to-spark-the-startup-scene-in-seattle/">Foundations</a>, where veteran founders and investors can help newer entrepreneurs.</p>



<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, the most valuable help that a founder gets will come from other founders and investors who understand what it means to build a venture-scale company,&#8221; Crimmins said.</p>



<p>Crimmins has a small team that helps run operations for Startup Haven, as well as venture partners (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaywesterdal/">Jay Westerdal</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arryshin/">Arry Yu</a>) and an investment director (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbembac/">Claudius Mbemba</a>) that support the fund. There are also <a href="https://startuphaven.com/team/">chapter directors</a> in each city.</p>

<p>Seattle-based video game developer <a href="https://starform.co/">Starform</a> raised $6 million in a new funding round to continue work on its air combat game <em>Metalstorm</em>.</p>



<p>The new round of funding was led by BITKRAFT Ventures, with additional participation from Dune Ventures. This brings Starform’s total funding to over $13 million, following previous rounds in <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/seattle-gaming-mainstays-raise-cash-new-mobile-studio-starform/">2019</a> and <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/z2-vets-raise-5m-grow-seattle-studio-starform-launch-social-games/">2021</a>.</p>



<p>The new funding will be used for player outreach, to get more people playing <em>Metalstorm</em>, as well as to expand Starform’s development team, Starform said in a press release.</p>



<p>Starform also announced that <em>Metalstorm</em> has reached an audience of 3 million players across mobile and PC <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-startup-starform-led-by-z2-vets-ready-to-take-flight-with-aerial-combat-game-metalstorm/">since its public debut last year</a>. Currently available on Google Play, the Apple App Store, and the Epic Games Store, <em>Metalstorm </em>is a team-based 5v5 game where players fly various historically-inspired combat planes against one another. Each plane has its own unique abilities inspired by its real-world capabilities.</p>



<p><em>Metalstorm </em>is currently scheduled for release on additional platforms in 2025, though Starform has not specified which ones.</p>



<p>“We believe in crafting short-session experiences that unite players across platforms,” said Lou Fasulo, CEO and co-founder of Starform, in a press release. “<em>Metalstorm</em> is all about facilitating connections—whether among friends or new acquaintances—through shared, thrilling gameplay that fits seamlessly into busy schedules.”</p>



<p>Starform was founded in 2018 by Fasulo, Taylor Daynes, Josh Rosen, and Jason English, all of whom formerly worked at the Seattle-based mobile studio Z2 before its <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2015/candy-crush-maker-king-buys-seattle-mobile-gaming-company-z2-150-million/">acquisition by King in 2015</a>.</p>



<p>Starform’s latest round fits into what’s become a modest upswing in VC funding for the games industry. After a sustained lean period over the last two years, total deal value in the space has risen for four consecutive quarters, <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q3-2024-gaming-report">as tracked by PitchBook</a>. It suggests that investors are slowly moving back into the industry after the post-COVID bust, which saw a plummet in deal value and a sustained period of contraction.</p>

<p>Seattle-area smart-home device maker <a href="https://www.wyze.com/">Wyze Labs</a> and Amazon-owned <a href="https://ring.com/">Ring</a>, among others, could be set to face new competition in the home security camera market from Apple.</p>



<p>Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/goertek-secures-npi-supplier-for-two-new-apple-products-in-2026-apple-business-set-to-resume-80f31db1dd4e">reported Tuesday</a> that the tech giant plans to make its first foray into the smart home IP camera market in 2026, with plans to ship more than 10 million units per year.</p>



<p>&#8220;This strategic move demonstrates Apple’s continued exploration of growth opportunities in the home market,&#8221; Kuo wrote. &#8220;I believe the user experience will be significantly enhanced by Apple’s great ecosystem and deep integration with Apple Intelligence and Siri.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/rings-new-premium-ai-feature-makes-video-history-searchable-by-keyword/">Ring released</a> its AI-powered &#8220;Smart Video Search&#8221; feature in October, allowing users to search the video archive from their doorbells and other Ring cameras using keywords. The feature uses an AI system called Ring IQ, and a vision language model to match text to images.</p>



<p>Kirkland, Wash.-based Wyze released its own AI search feature for specific moments in security-camera videos in August. The company previously said it&#8217;s been working on AI integrations for its products since 2019.</p>



<p>Wyze just released a new <a href="https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us/articles/30060320846363-Introducing-Wyze-Duo-Cam-Doorbell">Duo Cam Doorbell</a> offering two views — one intended for visitors and another pointed down for packages.</p>



<p>Ranked No. 9 on the <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/geekwire-200/">GeekWire 200</a> list of top Pacific Northwest startups, Wyze <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/smart-home-device-maker-wyze-raises-110m-plans-inject-ai-heavily-camera-products/">raised</a> $110 million in 2021. Founded in 2017 by a trio of Amazon veterans, the company started with security cameras but expanded to various other smart-home devices.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294508/apple-home-camera-smart-security-camera-2026">The Verge</a> noted Tuesday that security cameras make good sense for Apple as it looks for its next hardware hit.</p>



<p>The site pointed out that Apple’s HomeKit Secure Video service (HKSV), which is included in Apple’s iCloud plan, stores recorded footage from cameras. It requires an Apple Home Hub, such as a HomePod or AppleTV, which can analyze footage and send specific alerts for people, animals, vehicles, and packages. The Verge added that Apple’s smart home platform, Apple Home, currently supports integration with third-party cameras from several companies for live streaming footage to the app, but only a handful of cameras support HKSV.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tony-alika-owens-a53a794/">Tony Alika Owens</a>, a longtime tech exec who previously spent a decade at Salesforce, was named CEO at <a href="https://amperity.com/">Amperity</a>, a Seattle-based startup that helps companies collect and manage customer data. </p>



<p>Owens, who also worked at Oracle and was most recently a president at conversational commerce company LivePerson, tells GeekWire he was drawn Amperity&#8217;s &#8220;massive market opportunity.&#8221; </p>



<p>Founded in 2016, Amperity reached a billion-dollar valuation in 2021 after raising $100 million. The company established itself as a leader in the customer data platform sector, or CDP.</p>



<p>Amperity helps companies fine-tune marketing campaigns and understand buying habits by connecting fragmented data sources about individual customers via emails, purchase history, mobile app usage, website traffic, physical store visits, and more. </p>



<p>Owens said tailwinds from the AI boom and increasing amounts of first-party and synthetic data will help boost the value of a tool like Amperity. </p>



<p>He said the company &#8220;nails it over everybody&#8221; with its ability to organize customer data in a specific way and then &#8220;load that into applications where our customers can derive value.&#8221;</p>



<p>Amperity earlier this year announced&nbsp;<a href="https://amperity.com/announcements/amperity-redefines-composability-with-the-worlds-first-lakehouse-cdp">Lakehouse CDP</a>&nbsp;to help companies streamline how customer data is shared and managed internally. It also has a product called AmpAi that uses AI to boost data analysis and forecasting.</p>



<p>Owens said the company plans to roll out more products targeted at technical users, such as data scientists. He said customers &#8220;want to put the keys in the hands of those people that are more on the technical side of the house.&#8221;</p>



<p>Customers include Alaska Airlines, DICK&#8217;s Sporting Goods, Under Armour, Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts. Owens sees potential to add smaller-sized companies as new customers.</p>



<p>&#8220;A lot of our revenue is mid-enterprise and enterprise,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have the opportunity to start moving down the stack.&#8221;</p>



<p>The company declined to share revenue metrics. </p>



<p>Amperity has a number of <a href="https://www.cxtoday.com/data-analytics/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-customer-data-platforms-2024/">competitors</a>, including Salesforce, Adobe, Tealium, Treasure Data, Portland, Ore.-based Lytics, and others.</p>



<p>Amperity, ranked No. 16 on the <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/geekwire-200/">GeekWire 200</a>, has gone through multiple rounds of layoffs over the past few years. Owens said the 260-person company, along with many others during the recent venture capital boom times, may have invested in growth too aggressively before the tech slowdown that began in 2022.</p>



<p>But he&#8217;s bullish on the company&#8217;s current financial outlook. &#8220;I think a lot of folks are going to struggle,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have an opportunity to be in a position of strength.&#8221;</p>



<p>Owens is the company&#8217;s third CEO since early 2022, when ex-CEO and co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kabirshahani">Kabir Shahani</a> abruptly departed.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barrypadgett">Barry Padgett</a>, who took over for Shahani, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/amperity-ceo-barry-padgett-stepping-down-from-seattle-startup/">announced</a> earlier this year that he would step down. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisjones9/">Chris Jones</a>, Amperity’s customer and product officer, filled in for Padgett as the company&#8217;s interim CEO. He&#8217;s now a senior vice president.</p>



<p>Owens also joined Amperity&#8217;s board as a result of his new role. Other board members include Concur co-founder and Accolade CEO Raj Singh; Madrona Managing Director Matt McIlwain; Kevin Johnson, former president and CEO of Starbucks; and music superstar Ciara.</p>



<p>Amperity co-founder&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/derekslager/">Derek Slager</a>, who is also on the board,&nbsp;is still in his original role as chief technology officer.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m incredibly excited and confident in Tony&#8217;s leadership as we enter our next phase of growth,&#8221; Slager said in a statement.</p>

<p>When he was growing up in Houston, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/uri-shumlak-41667124a/">Uri Shumlak </a>used to pump gas at a local station. He remembers the oil embargo and gas shortages in the 1970s that caused drivers to line up for blocks, waiting and hoping to fill up their tanks.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even then, as a kid, I recognized that energy and our ability to produce power was so important I thought &#8230; there must be a better way than in gasoline,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Then in 1979 came the partial meltdown of a nuclear power reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.  </p>



<p>&#8220;It actually more piqued my interest than frightened it,&#8221; Shumlak said. &#8220;I wanted to learn more about nuclear energy and what its promises were for providing clean energy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shumlak &#8212; an uncommon thinker to the core &#8212; followed the thread of these impactful events, ultimately co-founding <a href="https://www.zapenergy.com/">Zap Energy</a>, a fusion power company based in Everett, Wash., and becoming a lauded professor at the University of Washington. In seven years, Zap has raised more than $330 million from investors and has a 150-person team that&#8217;s pursuing a nearly limitless source of carbon-free power.</p>



<p>The path hasn&#8217;t been easy &#8212; a failed first startup nearly soured Shumlak on entrepreneurship and fusion energy is one of the hardest challenges humans have tackled. The physicist is humble, but undaunted in his pursuit. </p>



<p>&#8220;It is such an important task &#8230; the potential to deliver fusion energy to civilization,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve devoted my career to try to work on these very challenging but important topics.&#8221;</p>



<p>UW Professor <a href="https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/bhuvana-srinivasan">Bhuvana Srinivasan</a> was a graduate student with Shumlak and is now a colleague. She admires his rigorous pursuit of a fundamental understanding of his approach to fusion power. Srinivasan praised his mentorship as respectful, encouraging, and striking the right balance between support and independence for students doing experiments that go &#8220;into unknown territory.&#8221;</p>



<p>“He fosters creativity,&#8221; she said, and when it comes to the Uncommon Thinkers recognition, &#8220;he’s absolutely deserving of such an award.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">In pursuit of fusion</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full-width"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="630" height="420" src="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CenturyStack-4-630x420.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-843047" srcset="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CenturyStack-4-630x420.jpg 630w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CenturyStack-4-1260x840.jpg 1260w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CenturyStack-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CenturyStack-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CenturyStack-4-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Employees at Zap Energy working on its new device called Century, which is a fully-integrated demonstration of major power plant-relevant technologies.

<p>Fusion energy is being created all the time by the sun and stars &#8212; but efficiently replicating the reactions on earth has so far eluded physicists. The reaction requires devices generating enough heat and pressure for a long enough time to slam light atoms together and make them stick. </p>



<p>Shumlak&#8217;s interest in fusion was sparked in a high school physics class and he earned an undergrad degree in nuclear engineering from Texas A&amp;M &#8212; though it included only one course in fusion, with most of the focus on atom-splitting fission, which powers today&#8217;s nuclear reactors. He selected the University of California, Berkeley, for his Ph.D. as researchers there were actively investigating fusion.</p>



<p>At the time the research was centered on large, super expensive fusion devices with complicated systems of lasers and giant magnets &#8212; projects like the experimental, academic reactors at Princeton University, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and the international fusion effort called ITER.</p>



<p>Shumlak deviated from the mainstream approach, pursuing smaller devices with simpler engineering. </p>



<p>&#8220;I just thought they were more elegant,&#8221; he said. </p>



<p>Shumlak was particularly interested in the physics of plasma, which is a state of matter (along with liquid, solid and gas) and a condition essential for creating fusion. The prevailing thought had been that plasmas are static nature. But from experiments he&#8217;d done, Shumlak knew they were dynamic and could move in a flow. </p>



<p>He took a job at the UW, which had a history of studying alternative fusion concepts, and continued pursuing this line of inquiry. Shumlak joined the UW&#8217;s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and was working on theories and simulations of a concept called Z pinch that relies on flowing plasma to contain and compress the matter.</p>



<p>He engaged with researchers in other departments and made a fortuitous connection with electrical engineering professor<a href="https://people.ece.uw.edu/nelson/"> Brian Nelson</a>.</p>



<p>Nelson was &#8220;a really great experimentalist,&#8221; Shumlak said, and they started building and testing Z pinch devices. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">&#8216;Doing something great and beautiful&#8217;</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full-width"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="630" height="473" src="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20220503_Zap-Energy-1919-630x473.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-848203" srcset="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20220503_Zap-Energy-1919-630x473.jpg 630w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20220503_Zap-Energy-1919-1260x945.jpg 1260w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20220503_Zap-Energy-1919-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20220503_Zap-Energy-1919-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20220503_Zap-Energy-1919-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Zap Energy co-founders from left: Uri Shumlak, Brian Nelson and Benj Conway.

<p>The Z pinch technology proved promising for plasma creation &#8212; and could also produce what&#8217;s known as extreme UV light. The light has super short wavelengths and there was a potential application in semiconductor fabrication, so Shumlak and Nelson co-founded a startup called Zplasma to commercialize the tech. The business was unable to compete against a more established company in the field. It folded after six years.</p>



<p>Following the experience, Shumlak wasn&#8217;t interested in taking the startup plunge again. </p>



<p>But soon after, he and Nelson landed an ARPA-E grant, which is designed to support the development and commercialization of energy technologies, pushing them back into the business arena.</p>



<p>The two engineers partnered with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/995143188/">Benj Conway</a>, an entrepreneur, investor and former diplomat, to launch Zap Energy. Shumlak is chief scientist, Nelson is chief technologist and Conway is CEO.     </p>



<p>The company is named for their original Z pinch experiments, dubbed &#8220;ZaP.&#8221; And it&#8217;s a nod to Shumlak and Nelson&#8217;s shared appreciation for Frank Zappa, a prolific, inventive musical artist and composer whose many genres included, perhaps not coincidentally, jazz fusion.</p>

<p>Progress at Zap has accelerated, said Shumlak, as the headcount and footprint of the company rapidly expanded over the past four years. The team is experimenting with its fusion reactor, a device called FuZE-Q, as it works to produce more energy from fusion reactions than they take to produce &#8212; an fundamental challenge that fusion scientists everywhere are trying to overcome.</p>



<p>This summer Zap completed construction of its Century system, which allows for research into the many components beyond the reactor that will be needed to create power for the grid.</p>



<p>After so many years in pursuit of fusion energy, Shumlak knows that success is uncertain for Zap or any of the other companies striving to create a commercial fusion product. But he&#8217;s hopeful someone will get there, for the sake of civilization.</p>



<p>&#8220;We fusion researchers sometimes feel like medieval cathedral builders. You may never see the finished product, but nevertheless, you know you&#8217;re doing something great and beautiful,&#8221; he said, simply by advancing the science.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s incredibly rewarding,&#8221; Shumlak added, &#8220;and I can think of no larger impact that you could possibly make than by trying to solve fusion energy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Film and video game fans looking for another escape from reality have a new option in downtown Seattle with the opening this week of the new&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tombraiderseattle.com/">“Tomb Raider Experience Seattle: Escape from the Temple of Fire.”</a> </p>



<p>The immersive escape room, previewed by GeekWire on Monday, puts players in the world of protagonist Lara Croft, the British archaeologist and treasure hunter, as they have to avoid danger and solve an assortment of puzzles to move from room to room.</p>



<p>The action takes place in an ancient volcanic temple in Chile — accessed via fake helicopter ride, one&#8217;s imagination, and an elaborately built-out 4,000 square-foot space at 1122 Post Ave., a block off Seattle&#8217;s downtown waterfront.</p>



<p>The experience officially opens on Saturday, and is from Seattle-based <a href="https://hourglassescapes.com/">Hourglass Escapes</a>, under its banner Hourglass Attractions, in partnership with “Tomb Raider” creator&nbsp;<a href="https://www.crystaldynamics.com/studio/">Crystal Dynamics</a>. </p>



<p>Seth Wolfson, owner and creative director of Hourglass Escapes and co-owner of Hourglass Attractions, is a film and theme park veteran who has been designing and operating escape room experiences and video games since 2016. </p>



<p>&#8220;I think we surpassed what we wanted to do,&#8221; Wolfson said of the build-out, limited in some part by building dimensions. &#8220;We&#8217;re still kind of a mom-and-pop company. We didn&#8217;t have $20 million like you would for a ride at Disney.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wolfson thinks the 28-year-old &#8220;Tomb Raider&#8221; franchise is still a big enough draw to attract tourists and others drawn to downtown Seattle by the nearby Pike Place Market, aquarium, redeveloped waterfront and more.</p>



<p>&#8220;We want to be something that can be family friendly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s educational because you&#8217;re doing puzzles. It&#8217;s away from screen time for kids. It&#8217;s great for team building.&#8221;</p>



<p>The first “Tomb Raider” video game was released in 1996, and since then, the franchise has sold more than 95 million copies. There have also been three feature films.</p>



<p>The last time I played the &#8220;Tomb Raider&#8221; video game was in the late &#8217;90s when the debut title was available for my PlayStation 1. I would spend hours and hours trying to get Lara Croft through various adventures unscathed. In the experience on Monday, it took 90 minutes to move through six rooms.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full-width"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="630" height="473" src="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0869-630x473.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-848441" srcset="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0869-630x473.jpeg 630w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0869-1260x945.jpeg 1260w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0869-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0869-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0869-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A lot of the puzzles in the &#8220;Tomb Raider&#8221; rooms involve lighting up various elements, including these statues. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The puzzles were definitely challenging for our team of five people, and our guide Alex, armed with a touchscreen tablet, definitely broke the fourth wall on occasion to help us along.</p>



<p>The experience is augmented by a good deal of technology along the way, including various video displays, sound and lighting touches, the piped-in voices of Croft and evil scientists, and some realistic haptics including a good amount of shaking on the final escape pod out of Chile.</p>



<p>There is no physical encounter with Croft or any other actors, with the exception of the guide. The experience can accommodate up to 10 people at a time on a team, spaced out every 20 minutes. There are no jump scares of note — the thrill is designed to come from racing the clock to escape each room —&nbsp;but the age requirement is 10 and up. The rooms are mostly filled with blinking lights and props that make the spaces feel like an ancient tomb accented with modern scientific and tech touches.</p>



<p>The attraction, which will employ about 25 people, comes at a time when Amazon is developing a&nbsp;<a href="https://screenrant.com/amazon-tomb-raider-movie-reboot-confirmation-cast-story/">film reboot</a>&nbsp;of “Tomb Raider” as well as a&nbsp;<a href="https://screenrant.com/tomb-raider-amazon-prime-show-updates/">streaming TV series</a>. And it could serve as another way that the City of Seattle hopes to lure more visitors to the downtown core as part of Mayor Bruce Harrell’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.downtownisyou.com/">Downtown Activation Plan</a>.</p>



<p>Wolfson said the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, Downtown Seattle Association, and Visit Seattle have all been &#8220;really, really great&#8221; to work with and Seattle City Council President Sara Nelson has been an advocate for the business. </p>



<p><em>“Tomb Raider Experience Seattle: Escape from the Temple of Fire” will be open seven days a week from 9:20 a.m. to 10 p.m. Prices start at $49.</em></p>

<p>Wali is based in Seattle and is leaving the role of head of product for the Meta FinTech product team. He worked for the social media platform for more than five years. </p>



<p>Wali is a serial entrepreneur and was previously the founder of the Merit Foundation, an invite-only cryptocurrency firm; Crowd Interactive, a software design business focused on e-commerce; the software company FoxCommerce; and others.</p>



<p>In announcing his career move on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7260052377771139072/">LinkedIn</a>, Wali wrote that the role at Meta was his &#8220;first real job&#8221; after working for two decades as an entrepreneur.</p>



<p>&#8220;I took a leap of faith on Meta, and it certainly took one on me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As I look back over my tenure, I can say it is one of the best professional decisions I have ever made. I’ve grown tremendously as a leader and have had a front-row seat to what world-class execution, strategy and people management looks like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now living in Blacksburg, Va., Irving didn&#8217;t think twice when he spotted the machine, and he plopped down $150 to take it home.</p>



<p>&#8220;When I plugged it in, it failed quite violently and filled my office with smoke,&#8221; he said via a call with GeekWire this week. &#8220;It was a pretty gross experience.&#8221;</p>



<p>A blown capacitor was easy enough to replace, but Irving&#8217;s ultimate goal of getting the nearly 40-year-old machine hooked up to the modern internet would take a bit more effort.</p>

<p>Originally from North Carolina, Irving&#8217;s first computer was a hand-me-down from his dad — a Macintosh SE/30, that&#8217;s similar to the Macintosh Plus.</p>



<p>Irving studied computer science at Appalachian State University, and first came to Seattle in 2016 to visit a cousin. He knew he had to stay after a visit to Living Computers.</p>



<p>&#8220;I went there, spent an entire day there, and I was like, &#8216;I&#8217;ve got to work here,'&#8221; Irving said. &#8220;And over the next few months I applied to every job posting that they posted, and I eventually got in.&#8221;</p>



<p>As a guide, Irving gave tours and interacted with guests. He also helped keep machines on the floor operational, running a boot sequence or using magnetic tape to load operating systems on old equipment. He shadowed members of LCM&#8217;s engineering team on restorations, including a CDC 6500, teletypes, and an Apple Bandai Pippin that he helped get working.</p>



<p>Irving left the museum after almost two years for an engineer job at Seattle University, before heading back east for a job at Virginia Tech. He was saddened but not surprised by the eventual permanent closure of LCM.</p>



<p>&#8220;It had been closed for so long, I kind of saw it coming,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was of course sad to hear that it was all going to kind of be scattered to the wind.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Christie&#8217;s <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/auction-of-paul-allen-items-including-vintage-computers-einstein-letter-and-more-brings-in-10m/">auctioned computers and other items</a> from Allen&#8217;s collection in September, Irving dreamed about bidding on several things, including a <a href="https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/firsts-history-computing-paul-g-allen-collection/pdp-8-minicomputer-chess-set-115/230053">PDP-8 Minicomputer and chess set</a> that eventually sold for $35,280.</p>



<p>&#8220;While I worked at the museum, I got to design a few different exhibits,&#8221; Irving said. &#8220;Guests could come and play chess against this machine. If they beat this 1980s chess program, we would take a Polaroid picture of them and put that into a binder, and that was sort of our Hall of Fame.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">&#8216;Like the future meeting the past&#8217;</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>Irving calls himself a treasure hunter. He regularly goes to estate sales and thrift shops, and he&#8217;ll often pass on old computers because he doesn&#8217;t really need to add to the growing collection in his garage.</p>



<p>&#8220;Most of the time you don&#8217;t find anything. That&#8217;s the thrill of the hunt,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you do find something, like a Macintosh Plus, that&#8217;s a special day. I had to go for it.&#8221;</p>



<p>After replacing the blown capacitor —&nbsp;a procedure he learned from a former LCM systems engineer —&nbsp;Irving caught up on some games he played as a kid. But he soon wanted to connect to the internet. And while he figured out a relatively simple solution for that via a <a href="https://bluescsi.com/docs/Emulators">BlueSCSI</a> hard drive emulator and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/">Raspberry Pi Pico</a> chip, actually browsing web pages was more involved because of modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a>.</p>



<p>All that nitty gritty is explained in a 14-minute video (above) that Irving uploaded to his YouTube channel.</p>



<p>There are existing solutions to get vintage Macintoshes online, including the tool <a href="http://www.tidalpool.ca/macproxy/">MacProxy</a>, but &#8220;modern web pages just really aren&#8217;t designed with vintage computers in mind,&#8221; Irving said.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full-width"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="630" height="827" src="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/macintosh_plus-630x827.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-847978" srcset="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/macintosh_plus-630x827.jpg 630w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/macintosh_plus-960x1260.jpg 960w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/macintosh_plus-768x1008.jpg 768w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/macintosh_plus-1170x1536.jpg 1170w, https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/macintosh_plus.jpg 1312w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Running ChatGPT on a vintage Macintosh Plus. (Photo courtesy of Hunter Irving)</figcaption></figure>



<p>So he built his own tool, called MacProxy Plus, which translates and simplifies things to make it possible to view sites such as Reddit, Wikipedia, NPR.org, WayBack Machine, and more, as well as a reasonable facsimile of YouTube called &#8220;(not) YouTube&#8221; that (very slowly) plays videos.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/hunterirving/macproxy_plus">Everything is documented on a GitHub page</a> where Irving shares all of his code, because he wants others to have the same fun and breathe life into vintage machines everywhere.</p>



<p>&#8220;The end result is something that I feel would have been right at home in Allen&#8217;s museum,&#8221; Irving said.</p>



<p>And in 2024, when artificial intelligence and generative AI are the buzzwords of our time, Irving&#8217;s project has even allowed him to run OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT on the vintage interface, looking as if it were created in the 1980s. </p>



<p>For kicks, I asked ChatGPT if I could run the AI software on a 1986 Macintosh Plus computer. GPT replied that it was not possible due to limitations including hardware, the operating system, and lack of internet access.</p>



<p>ChatGPT, update your data collection and meet Hunter Irving.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s cool about it is it shouldn&#8217;t be possible, it shouldn&#8217;t be able to exist,&#8221; Irving said. &#8220;It&#8217;s like the future meeting the past. It&#8217;s a time machine that shocks you a little bit initially, and then you&#8217;re like, &#8216;Whoa, OK, this is kind of fun.'&#8221;</p>

<p><em>[This story originally appeared on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.realestatenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Real Estate News</a><strong>.</strong>]</em></p>



<p>BOSTON — Compass CEO Robert Reffkin has been vocal in his opposition to the National Association of Realtors&#8217; <a href="https://www.realestatenews.com/tag/clear-cooperation-policy">Clear Cooperation Policy</a>, which requires properties to be listed on the Multiple Listing Service within a day of being publicly marketed.</p>



<p>Which may be why people packed the conference room at the NAR NXT conference on Friday, buzzing with more anticipation than one might expect for a conversation about the future of multiple listing services.</p>



<p>The panel was packed too: Reffkin was joined by the CEOs of the nation&#8217;s two largest MLSs — Art Carter of CRMLS and Brian Donnellan of Bright MLS, who moderated the session — Errol Samuelson, Zillow&#8217;s chief industry development officer; and Kymber Lovett-Menkiti, co-owner and president of Keller Williams Capital Properties, a KW regional director and board member of Bright MLS.</p>



<p>Reffkin did not hold back when offering his vision of where the MLS is headed: &#8220;My view is that Zillow is going to be the MLS. It&#8217;s only a matter of time.&#8221;</p>



<p>And the crowd, which had burst into spontaneous applause at several points in the discussion, instead just murmured.</p>



<aside class="callout clearfix"><h4><a href="https://www.realestatenews.com/"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/realestatenews.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Real Estate News" /></a></h4><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><a href="https://www.realestatenews.com/2024/11/15/people-on-the-move-top-leaders-at-fathom-take-on-expanded-roles"><p>People on the Move: Top leaders at Fathom take on expanded roles</p></a></li><li><a href="https://www.realestatenews.com/2024/11/14/homebuying-demand-ticks-up-despite-elevated-rates"><p>Homebuying demand ticks up despite elevated rates</p></a></li><li><a href="https://www.realestatenews.com/2024/11/14/zillow-president-steps-down-company-names-new-coo"><p>Zillow president steps down, company names new COO</p></a></li></ul></aside>



<p>&#8220;What, no clap for that?&#8221; Reffkin said.</p>



<p>Samuelson, who had multiple applause lines, embodied the home search portal&#8217;s evolution from outsider to insider on a panel at NAR&#8217;s biggest event. It was an evolution that Donnellan remarked on, as did Reffkin — who also commented on Zillow&#8217;s rise to dominance, which he characterized as a self-inflicted wound on the industry.</p>



<p>Samuelson, for his part, reiterated Zillow&#8217;s support for the &#8220;incredibly pro-consumer&#8221; MLS system, a &#8220;two-sided marketplace with equal access to information.&#8221; Zillow once operated without MLS data, getting listings information directly from brokers. That&#8217;s not the future they&#8217;re looking toward, Samuelson told Real Estate News after the panel.</p>



<p>&#8220;The best agents win on skill, not information asymmetry,&#8221; Samuelson said during the panel, to loud applause.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The future of MLS: Cooperation, competition, consolidation</h4>



<p>MLSs were &#8220;built on cooperation and compensation,&#8221; said Donnellan. With offers of compensation removed from the MLS&nbsp;<a href="https://www.realestatenews.com/2024/04/28/commissions-lawsuits-faq-answers-to-top-questions">per NAR&#8217;s deal to settle commissions lawsuits</a>, can &#8220;we live with just one C?&#8221;</p>



<p>The answer was a resounding yes. &#8220;Data is more than enough to make an MLS worth it,&#8221; said Lovett-Menkiti. &#8220;Brokers need information.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And my job is to provide it,&#8221; chimed in Carter.</p>



<p>&#8220;The MLS is the biggest gift that the brokerage community has ever given the consumer and we need to double down on the cooperation aspect of that in order for our brokerages to really thrive,&#8221; Carter said. &#8221; And I think the multiple listing service is the one place that can bring all that information together, and where brokers work together.&#8221;</p>



<p>Samuelson took it a step further: &#8220;I&#8217;d like to see every MLS do a data share with every other MLS, then brokers have a choice.&#8221;</p>



<p>Carter didn&#8217;t skip a beat in replying, and got his own round of applause. &#8220;Brokerages should compete on service and price. MLSs should compete on service and price. They shouldn&#8217;t compete on whether or not I have the listing content for all of California. I should be able to have the listing content for all of California. Let me go out and service the brokerage community, and the best MLS will win at the end of the day.&#8221;</p>



<p>Reffkin, meanwhile, said he supports a strong MLS but argued that data should be offered in a more controlled way, saying information about days on market and price drops are &#8220;killers of value.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If buyers get that information, sellers should know more about buyers,&#8221; he said, like how long they&#8217;ve been searching for a house and how many offers they&#8217;ve made.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">More power to the sellers</h4>



<p>Reffkin&#8217;s theme was that sellers should have more control over their experience.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;re not treating the homeowners as clients,&#8221; he said, yet MLSs only exist because of seller listings. And homeowners deserve an environment with more options for how their information is shared. He resisted the urge to mention Clear Cooperation by name, but referred obliquely to the implications of its end. &#8220;I think competition for homeowners will ultimately give them better experience and more options.&#8221;</p>



<p>Reffkin also expressed frustration with listing agent attribution, or the lack of it.</p>



<p>&#8220;That attribution is something we fight for,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;I think it is the multiple listing services that should be defending the listing agent on the listing, and that is something that we at the CLS level actively do.&#8221;</p>



<p>After the panel was over, and after Reffkin held court with agents and other audience members who had gathered for photos to capture the event, Real Estate News asked Reffkin about his crusade against Clear Cooperation. He says it&#8217;s about sellers&#8217; rights. But for a company that is leaning into the idea of private listings, it could also be seen as self-serving.</p>



<p>Reffkin&#8217;s answer: &#8220;I think the concept that we&#8217;re debating, of whether or not homeowners have a choice, is beyond me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seattle City Councilmember <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/council/moore">Cathy Moore</a> is proposing a 2% capital gains excise tax modeled on a Washington state tax.</p>



<p>The local tax would be lower than the state&#8217;s 7% tax rate and would similarly apply to profits on the sales of stocks and bonds that exceed $250,000.</p>



<p>The proposal comes days after Washington voters overwhelmingly rejected Initiative 2109, a General Election ballot measure that would have eliminated the capital gains tax that went into effect two years ago. </p>



<p>While the state capital gains tax is earmarked for programs supporting public education and school construction, the city tax would fund initiatives that help people pay rent, assist with housing down payments, and provide food assistance for those in need. It would go into effect in 2026.</p>



<p>The City of Seattle is currently hashing out its 2025-26 budget and coming up short. It faces a $250 million shortfall in its general fund, which totals $1.9 billion. Seattle’s overall budget is $8.3 billion.</p>



<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;ve learned from the Council&#8217;s budget review, and my work as chair of the Housing and Human Services Committee, is that we still have real gaps in keeping people housed, getting homeless persons into shelter, access to home ownership opportunities, and a hunger crisis that is fast approaching,&#8221; Moore wrote in <a href="https://us12.campaign-archive.com/?u=11a79978ca7225050bfabf7ad&amp;id=86705673eb">her newsletter</a> on Thursday.  </p>



<p>The new tax could &#8220;address these ongoing significant gaps in our critical services,&#8221; Moore said. </p>



<p>Moore plans to introduce her budget proposal amendment at the <a href="https://council.seattle.gov/2024/11/08/councilmember-cathy-moore-proposes-progressive-capital-gains-excise-tax-to-fund-rental-assistance-home-ownership-and-fight-food-insecurity/">Nov. 12 meeting</a> of the full city council. She was voted into office last year and her district spans the north end of Seattle.   </p>



<p>Supporters of the failed ballot initiative to toss the Washington state tax argued that it harms small businesses and innovation and is detrimental to the region’s tech economy. They suggested the state could do more with the dollars it has. </p>



<p>This spring, 3,850 people statewide filed returns associated with their capital gains, though not all would have owed the tax, according to the state Department of Revenue. It&#8217;s unknown how many Seattle residents would be potentially impacted by a local tax. </p>



<p>Challenges in paying for programs that support low-income residents are nothing new for Seattle. </p>



<p>Five years ago city leaders passed a controversial tax intended to help fund affordable housing and homeless services. The Payroll Expense Tax or &#8220;JumpStart&#8221; evolved out of a years-long battle over how the city should tax employers such as Amazon, which launched in Seattle more than two decades ago and has become the city’s largest employer.</p>



<p>JumpStart is also earmarked to pay for equitable economic development projects, and Green New Deal investments to help the city meet its environmental goals. </p>



<p>The tax has brought in more revenue than originally projected, and since 2022 those additional dollars have been tapped to support the general fund. General fund expenditures cover public safety, administration, education and human services, arts and culture, and other programs.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattle-mayor-wants-to-tap-more-revenue-from-payroll-tax-on-big-business-to-plug-budget-holes/">budget proposed in September</a> by Mayor Bruce Harrell included the largest reallocation of the JumpStart funds to date.</p>



<p>The mayor doesn’t support Moore’s proposed tax “at this point,” Harrell spokesperson Callie Craighead <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattle-council-member-proposes-capital-gains-tax-at-city-level/">told the Seattle Times</a>, which first reported on the council member&#8217;s tax plan. Craighead said the mayor is receptive to having “a longer and more robust discussion” about revenue options.</p>

<p><a href="https://mtjoy.com/">Mt. Joy</a>, the fast-casual chicken sandwich restaurant built around sustainable farming practices, is opening its second location in Seattle. The new space, opening Nov. 19, will be at The Deck, an Amazon-owned food court in the South Lake Union neighborhood.</p>



<p>Founded by tech entrepreneur <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rcape/">Robbie Cape</a> and restaurateur <a href="https://www.ethanstowellrestaurants.com/">Ethan Stowell</a>, Mt. Joy opened its first brick-and-mortar restaurant <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/sustainable-chicken-sandwich-startup-lands-1-5m-and-opens-first-brick-and-mortar-spot-in-seattle/">last December</a> on Capitol Hill after getting started with a <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/tech-entrepreneur-robbie-cape-brings-a-taste-of-startup-life-to-mt-joy-his-new-seattle-chicken-joint/">food truck</a> in that neighborhood. The company raised $1.5 million from a variety of investors at the time.</p>



<p>Mt. Joy&#8217;s focus is on sustainable farming practices and locally sourced ingredients intended to disrupt the agriculture and food industries from start to finish.&nbsp;<a href="https://kisstheground.com/regenerative-agriculture/#what">Regenerative agriculture</a>&nbsp;is part of the mantra because of its potential to combat climate change by improving the organic makeup of soil and removing carbon from the atmosphere.</p>



<p>Kristen Rincon, Amazon’s head of asset management for North America, said in a statement that Mt. Joy’s practices help it align with the tech giant&#8217;s own Climate Pledge to reduce CO2 emissions.</p>



<p>The restaurant&#8217;s fried chicken sandwich is its flagship item, but Mt. Joy also offers tenders, wings, fries, a portobello sandwich, a vegan tofu wrap, and shakes. The company said it sources over 90% of its food from four states: Washington, Oregon, California and Idaho.</p>



<p>Mt. Joy says it plans to expand into more markets across the Pacific Northwest in 2025 and beyond.</p>



<p>Cape, Mt. Joy&#8217;s CEO, previously headed up telehealth company 98point6. He also spent 11 years at Microsoft and was co-founder and CEO at Cozi, a family organizing app.</p>



<p><em>Mt. Joy will hold an opening celebration at its new location on Nov. 19, 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. The Deck is located at 1051 Thomas St.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivaas/">Shivaas Gulati</a> needed a break.</p>



<p>More than 11 years after helping to start <a href="https://www.remitly.com/us/en">Remitly</a>, the Seattle digital remittance company, Gulati said building a tech company had taken its toll. In 2022, he moved with his family to London to step back and recharge and see how a couple years away would feel.</p>



<p>Energized and starting to think again about the passions and hobbies that excite him, Gulati zeroed in on something earlier this year.</p>



<p>&#8220;One day I was like, &#8216;I see a lot of football,&#8221; he said, using the more ubiquitous term for soccer outside of the U.S.</p>



<p>He began to explore where his passion for sports and soccer could intersect with his tech background, seeking to better understand how soccer clubs are run, what the business challenges are, and if and how they use technology.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tech is everywhere,&#8221; Gulati said. &#8220;Every company uses it in some way or the other. And sports is no different.&#8221;</p>



<p>After talking to numerous clubs, Gulati seized on the opportunity to join an ownership consortium that purchased <a href="https://www.southendunited.co.uk/">Southend United</a>, a football club founded in 1906 and located in Southend-on-Sea, about an hour from London. The team competes in the National League — the fifth tier of English football, in which the Premier League is tops.</p>



<p>The announcement was made official on Friday, and with his investment and board seat, Gulati becomes the 11th member of the consortium — dubbed Custodians of Southend United. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="630" height="360" src="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/co-founders-630x360-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-848226"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Shivaas Gulati, right, with Remitly co-founders Josh Hug, left, and Matt Oppenheimer. (Remitly File Photo)
</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gulati has also returned to Seattle where he remains plugged into Seattle&#8217;s tech scene. The longtime angel investor recently joined the board of <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/can-this-new-community-hub-provide-a-spark-for-seattles-startup-ecosystem/">Foundations</a>, an organization to support startup founders with shared workspace, mentorship and more.</p>



<p>But from a distance and via frequent trips back to England, Gulati will pursue his soccer passion and use his background to help guide a more robust technology adoption at Southend. As with teams in Seattle, such as the Sounders and others, that translates to advances on the playing side —&nbsp;wearables, player analytics, game analytics, scouting, recruiting — and the business side — fan engagement, commercial opportunities, strategic partnerships, etc.</p>



<p>&#8220;We can reach every fan individually in a personalized way today that wasn&#8217;t possible a decade-plus ago,&#8221; Gulati said.</p>



<p>And artificial intelligence, as it seems to be doing across every other industry and business, will play a role. Gulati said the more forward-thinking organizations are already considering how to invest in and use AI.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you think about a startup&#8217;s journey, you have an idea, you prototype it, you test it for a few months, and then you start to grow it, and you want to hit product market fit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think AI and sports will be similar, where clubs will start testing it, and then they&#8217;ll hit product market fit with that initiative, and then it&#8217;ll take off.&#8221;</p>



<p>Half a million people live in Essex County where Southend is based, Gulati said. To engage with and deepen the relationship with that potential fan base, he&#8217;s thinking about software and AI.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have to go out and hire a team of, let&#8217;s say, performance analytics, people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can build those things in house and have AI help us to augment our coaching staff or uncover new business opportunities in the region.&#8221;</p>



<p>Gulati and Justin Rees, an Australian entrepreneur who is chairman of the consortium, even used AI to bypass lawyers and draft Gulati&#8217;s purchase agreement and contracts.</p>



<p>Sports businesses are not any different than any other business, in Gulati&#8217;s view. Challenges such as strategic alignment, execution, tracking goals, measuring performance, coming up with metrics, coming up with ideas — those same problems exist in a football club.</p>



<p>And there are a lot of similarities in terms of execution.</p>



<p>&#8220;The same kind of grit, tenacity, planning and iteration you need in a startup or a tech company, I hope to bring all that to Southend and use that as an advantage,&#8221; Gulati said.</p>
